<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>The "Cid Campeador" has been for centuries the great
popular hero of Spain. He takes the same place in that
country as King Arthur does in England, Roland, or Rolando,
in France, and William Tell in Switzerland; and, like them,
his life and exploits are, to a great extent, founded on popular
traditions. In English-speaking countries there is very little
known respecting him, and the translator ventures to place
before the public a work which is considered by Spaniards to
be one of the best historical romances in their literature. It
is founded on a large number of ballads and other poetical
pieces, extant in Spain for centuries, and on a very old work
named "The Chronicle of the Cid."</p>

<p>The Author writes in his Introduction: "The Cid is the
most popular of the Castilian heroes, and not without reason,
for in him are personified all the virtues of the citizen and of
the soldier. A good son, he avenges the insults offered to his
father by bravely fighting with the Count of Gormaz: a good
cavalier and faithful lover, he gives his hand and heart to the
daughter of the man whom he had slain in fair combat: a good
monarchist, he risks the anger of King Alfonzo by compelling
him to take an oath that he was not guilty of a crime which
would stain the throne of Fernando the Great: a good soldier
and a good vassal, he conquers, with his invincible sword,
hostile realms and Moorish kings, and lays at the feet of his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span>
sovereign, who had unjustly banished him, the spoils which
he had won and the countries of which he had made himself
master: a good patrician, loving the glory and the preponderance
of his native land, he proceeds to Rome, enters the Church
of St. Peter, and seeing in the place of honour the seat of the
representative of France, he breaks it in pieces, filled with
indignation, and puts in its place that of the representative of
Spain: and finally, a good Christian, a good husband, and a
good father; before entering into the combats, when calling
upon God, he also uses the names of his wife and children,
over whom he had wept when parting from them,&mdash;he who,
in battle, showed a heart more hard than the armour which
covered it."</p>

<p class="ft200">THE CID CAMPEADOR</p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">WHICH TREATS OF SOME LOVE AFFAIRS WHICH COMMENCED
ALMOST WHEN OTHERS END</p></blockquote>


<p>Joyous festivities were being celebrated at the Court of
Leon in the spring of <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1053. Don Fernando I.,
King of Castile and Leon, had journeyed to Najera to
visit his brother Don Garcia, King of Navarre, who was
sojourning, in bad health, in that town; but, having learned
that Don Garcia desired to take him prisoner, on account of
certain matters which were pending between them, regarding
the partition of their late father's kingdom, he quickly withdrew
to a place of safety. Don Garcia having gone, in his
turn, to visit his brother, was incarcerated in the Castle of Cea.
However, having succeeded in escaping from it, he summoned
the Moors to his aid, and entered Castile, determined on
revenge, and committed horrible atrocities. Don Fernando
sallied forth to meet him, engaged with him at Atapuerca, not
far from Burgos, and the invading army was completely routed.
Don Garcia was killed by a lance-wound inflicted on him by a
soldier named Sancho Fortun, who had gone over to the
service of Don Fernando.</p>

<p>This, then, was the occasion of the festivities to which we
have alluded, festivities which had attracted to the Court great
numbers of ladies and cavaliers, not alone from Castile and
Leon, but also from the other kingdoms, into which, at that
time, Spain was divided. There had been various games, and
a splendid tournament had taken place, in which Don Fernando
had broken lances with the bravest and most polished cavaliers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of the period&mdash;a period so celebrated for skilful jousters and
valiant warriors.</p>

<p>Night having come on, the dances, games, and jousts
ceased, and great bonfires were lighted up in the open places
of the town and in the surrounding fields, where the people
continued the rejoicings until the approach of morning. They
mingled their songs and acclamations with the continuous
clanging of the bells and the sounds of the rustic musical
instruments used in those times, until the ladies and cavaliers
filled up the halls of the royal Alcazar. In them was to be
celebrated a ball well worthy of the festivities that had taken
place on that memorable day, the remembrance of which both
Castilians and Leonese preserved for long years after, on
account of the favours which their king dealt out to them
with a generous hand.</p>

<p>If we were to paint with rich and vivid colours the halls in
which was assembled the Court of Don Fernando, we should
perchance please readers fond of the marvellous and magnificent.
The picture would indeed be very effective, but we
should fail in strict adherence to truth, and in our intention to
sacrifice everything for its sake, during the long course of events
which we are about to describe. The spirit of independence
which reigned at that period in Castile had driven out the
Eastern luxury which the Moslims were in the habit of displaying,
during four centuries, in the southern parts of Spain. The
contemporaries of the Cid were as brave and manly as the
heroes of Covadonga, but also as rude and simple-minded as
the first champions of the Holy Crusade, who had succeeded
in driving back into the African deserts the impious followers
of the Crescent. Light and flowers were the riches which
abounded in the halls of the Alcazar of Leon&mdash;light and flowers
which are the riches of the fields, the luxury of nature. However,
if any discontented person found those decorations too
insignificant, he must have found compensation in the beauteous
dames and brave knights who moved about in all directions,
evidently well pleased and content. All were impatiently
awaiting the arrival of the king, which was to be the prelude
to the dancing and to the other amusements proper to the
occasion and to the period, when the voice of a page was
heard above the buzz of the crowd, announcing the approach
of Don Fernando and his family. A profound silence reigned
throughout the saloons, and all looks were fixed on the door
which communicated with the royal apartments. And, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Don Fernando immediately appeared, accompanied by his
queen Doña Sancha, by his daughters Elvira and Urraca, by
his sons, Sancho, Alfonso, and Garcia, and by some grandees
who, during the day, had had the honour of accompanying
him, and whom the king had invited to his table. Amongst
these last universal attention was centred on an old man of
noble appearance, to whom Don Fernando directed his conversation
frequently and with great kindness. That old
grandee was the noble Diego Lainez, lord of Vivar.</p>

<p>We have said that all looks were fixed on the royal family,
but for our credit sake, as true and accurate narrators, we
must make an exception. At one end of the principal hall a
gentle maiden, who might count perhaps twenty summers,
was conversing, without paying attention to their arrival, with
a handsome youth not much more advanced in years. The
importunities of a rather ancient dueña, who evidently feared
that they might be noticed, judging from the terrified way in
which she frequently gazed around, did not succeed in interrupting
their confidential chat, which to all appearance was
of an amatory character. The two young persons were Ximena,
daughter of the Count de Gormaz, and Rodrigo, son of Diego
Lainez; the elderly lady, who showed herself so uneasy, was
Lambra, the dueña of the young girl.</p>

<p>The conversation between them was indeed of the nature
mentioned above, for Rodrigo and Ximena loved each other
from the years of their childhood, and love was always the
subject of their conversations. Let us tell how the son of
Diego Lainez and the daughter of Don Gome de Gormaz first
became lovers. Bonds of friendship and relationship&mdash;the
latter, however, rather distant&mdash;had united for very many years
the two families. On the occasion of the celebration of certain
famous tournaments at Vivar, Don Gome and his family
repaired thither, and were hospitably lodged in the house of
Diego Lainez. Rodrigo at that time was four years old, and
Ximena, whose parents had brought her with them to Vivar,
but little younger. Diego Lainez, to do honour to his friends,
gave a banquet sufficiently splendid and abundant, when the
traditional frugality in his household is taken into consideration.
On this occasion the two gentlemen renewed their
pledges of friendship.</p>

<p>Teresa Nuña, the noble wife of Diego, loved her son with a
tenderness only to be compared with that with which the wife
of De Gormaz loved her daughter. The children rivalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
each other in beauty and grace, and the two mothers started a
friendly and praiseworthy discussion on that subject, after the
termination of the banquet. We call it praiseworthy, because
maternal pride is noble and holy, although it may appear
unreasonable to those who judge it dispassionately. That
controversy ended by all those present, including the fathers
of the children, agreeing that they were equal in beauty and
grace, as they were almost equal in age.</p>

<p>"They seem made for each other," said Teresa Nuña. And
from that opinion a thought took birth which was received
with enthusiasm by both families&mdash;to enlace more and more
their interests and friendship by the union of Rodrigo and
Ximena. The realisation of this project was arranged for the
time when the two fair scions of those noble families would
have completed their twentieth years; for in that iron age all
the risks to life and health attending the too early marriages
of young girls were, with good reason, avoided.</p>

<p>Love, and above all the love of a mother, is the source of
the most beautiful and poetic thoughts; thus it was that
Teresa was inspired with a very beautiful idea. It was, that
the children should consecrate this arrangement for their future
union with a kiss, which also should be the pledge of a love
that commenced on that day. Teresa Nuña, therefore, took
Rodrigo by the hand and led him up to Ximena; he then
sealed with his pure lips the blushing cheek of the girl, who,
in her turn, kissed that of Rodrigo.</p>

<p>This compact was a bond which made the intercourse of
the two families more close than it had been before, and the
two children grew up like two flowers on one stem&mdash;brother
and sister in their education as they were also in their
souls.</p>

<p>Many years passed, and nothing had disturbed the warm
friendship of the two noble families; however, some special
privileges conferred on Diego Lainez at the Court of King
Fernando, with whom the two grandees had enjoyed much
favour, irritated De Gormaz, whose nature, to judge by some
circumstances which had arisen anterior to those which afterwards
took place, was widely different, in nobleness and
generosity, from that of Diego. Indeed, thanks to the
prudence of the latter, a complete estrangement had been
avoided until a short time before the events which we have
narrated at the beginning of this chapter; but at last De
Gormaz took the initiative by ordering his daughter to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
no communication whatever with Rodrigo, threatening Lambra
to expel her from his household if she permitted such.</p>

<p>On the day of which we are now treating the exasperation
and the anger of De Gormaz rose to their highest point, on
account of the kindness shown by the king to Diego, and, on
the other hand, by the coldness with which he himself had
been received, and above all, by the slight which he considered
had been cast on him, by his not having been invited to the
royal table, as had been Diego Lainez, to whom he attributed
his disgrace with the king. Certainly Diego was very far indeed
from meriting such an accusation on the part of his former
friend, for on that very day he had done his utmost to
rehabilitate him in the eyes of Don Fernando; the king, however,
had just motives for complaint against the count, and
the good offices of De Vivar had been unavailing.</p>

<p>At the moment when the entry of the royal family into the
saloons of the Alcazar was announced, Don Gome was passing
through them, accompanied by his daughter. Although
feeling much resentment, on account of the coldness of the
king, he did not wish to renounce all chance of recovering
the favour of Don Fernando, provoking afresh his resentment
by abstaining from joining his suite, and thus acting differently
from all the other cavaliers who were passing through the
saloons. It so happened that, charging Lambra with the care
of his daughter, he advanced towards the royal family.
Rodrigo, who was watching for an opportunity to speak to the
young girl, saw heaven opened when he perceived that she
was free from the presence of her father, and flew to her side
despite the anxiety which he knew it would cause the
dueña.</p>

<p>Many days had passed since Ximena had seen him, and it
is easy to imagine what was her pleasure, taking into account
the tender and old love which united them.</p>

<p>"Ximena!" murmured Rodrigo in a low voice, trembling
with emotion.</p>

<p>"Rodrigo!" whispered the girl, without being able to add
another word.</p>

<p>"By all the saints of the heavenly court," said the terrified
dueña, directing an entreating gesture to Rodrigo, "I ask you
to depart hence, for if the count sees you it will go ill with
my lady and with me. You doubtless do not know that he
has threatened to cut my skirts short, in order to disgrace me,
if I allow my lady to hold any converse with you. I beseech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
you to do nothing to increase his anger, as things have not
gone well with him to-day."</p>

<p>"Fear nothing, honoured dueña," replied Rodrigo, "for if
the count cuts your skirts short I shall give you others made
of the richest cloth."</p>

<p>"I know well that you are a cavalier, and it is the prerogative
of cavaliers to be generous. Speak with my lady;
but be brief. I shall meantime keep watch, and say my beads
that my lord may not see ye."</p>

<p>Rodrigo and Ximena were already conversing, not paying
the slightest attention to the words of Lambra.</p>

<p>"Rodrigo," said Ximena, "whither have gone those happy
times when the houses of De Vivar and De Gormaz were as
one trunk with two branches; when no cloud obscured the
bright sky of our loves; when we saw the distant horizon rosy
and beautiful before us; when I found in your parents the
love which you found in mine? Vain have been your efforts,
vain have been mine, and vain also have been those of your
friends and mine, to appease the enmity which now separates
our noble parents."</p>

<p>"That time, Ximena, has not, perhaps, passed away never
to return. My father, the son of Lain Calvo, although old,
preserves, in youthful luxuriance, the noble pride of ancestry,
and it would not correspond with such dignity if he were to
bear with patience the unjust suspicions with which your father
has responded to his friendship. For a long time he has
borne them, Ximena. I indeed might humiliate myself
before your father, without such humiliation casting a stain on
me, for I would do it for your sake, and no reproach could be
directed against him who humiliates himself for a lady. What
does your father desire? Honours; riches; a kingdom; a
throne for his daughter? You shall have all that, Ximena, I
swear it by our love and by the honour of my ancestors. My
arm is strong and my heart full of courage. Even to-morrow
I shall set out for the country of our enemies. I shall enter
the territory of the Moors, I shall fight as Bernardo fought at
Roncesvalles, and I shall be victorious; for that love, which I
have cherished for you during so many years, will make me
invincible; and I shall lay all at the feet of your father,
demanding, as a recompense, your hand and the return of
the friendship which, at one time, was equal to ours for him."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said Doña Lambra, "my lord is just
coming, and you, Don Rodrigo, will be the victim of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
anger; and if he cuts my skirts short, good-bye to those of
rich cloth!"</p>

<p>The two lovers paid little attention to the inquietude and
the ridiculous words of the dueña.</p>

<p>"I know well, Ximena," continued Rodrigo, "that your
father will use every means in order to avenge his supposed
injuries on mine, and perchance I, the idol of Diego Lainez,
shall be the first victim of his attempts; for, in order to wound
the heart of the father, he will wound that of the son, by
taking from me the hope of gaining the sole object of my
ambition, which is yourself, Ximena. However, if the love
which you often have sworn to me is real, if you hold in any
account the happiness, the hopes, the life of the companion of
your childhood, of him who has dreamed of such felicity with
you, you will know how to resist his endeavours until the day
shall come when Rodrigo will return to Castile, worthy of the
daughter of a king. Then pride will compel him to grant that
which his ambition, thwarted in its hopes, now denies to me."</p>

<p>"I swear to you," answered Ximena, in one of those bursts
of enthusiasm in which, without taking reason into account,
all things appear possible to us,&mdash;"I swear to you that nothing
in this world shall be able to conquer my resolve,&mdash;I shall be
the wife of Rodrigo or of none other. My father may be able
to extinguish the breath of my lungs, but never the love of my
heart."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Rodrigo, "blessed was the day when my
eyes first looked on you! Perhaps, without the love of
Ximena, Rodrigo Diaz would be one of those plants which
spring up, live, and die, without having borne any fruit; one
of those men who pass through the world without leaving a
trace which might point out his path to those who come after
him; your love, however, will immortalise his name; by him
the plains of Castile will be stained by Moslim blood; through
him the standard of Mahomet will be trampled under foot by
the Christian kingdoms; in him the weak and the oppressed
shall have an arm to sustain and defend them; and through
him the race of the Counts of Castile shall wear the royal
purple."</p>

<p>Whilst thus speaking, forgetting where he was, the cheeks of
Rodrigo flushed, his broad and noble brow lit up, and his eyes
sparkled, as if all the fire that inflamed his heart flew to his
head. The eyes of Ximena shone also with joy, and her heart
beat with violence, agitated by love and pride,&mdash;by pride, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the daughter of a king would have felt it, knowing she was
loved by such a generous and brave youth, to whom she
desired to return, in her ardent glances, all the treasures of
love which were shut up in her soul.</p>

<p>The anxiety of Lambra was increasing every moment, and
not without cause; for the crowd which had collected around
the royal family, curiosity being satisfied, was moving off and
distributing itself through the saloons; and the honoured
dueña feared the return of her master, or that someone might
notice her complacency and report it to him.</p>

<p>"Ah! my skirts!" she said, moving in between Ximena
and Rodrigo, "my master is coming, and he will cut them
short without remedy!"</p>

<p>A group of cavaliers came from the farthest end of the hall,
and Rodrigo thought he saw amongst them Don Gome.</p>

<p>"Adieu, Ximena," the young man hastened to say; "either
everything or nothing, either death or Ximena!"</p>

<p>"Either Rodrigo or nothing!" replied the young girl,
following with her glances her lover, who was just issuing from
the halls of the Alcazar at the instant that the count was
returning to the side of his daughter.</p>

<p>An unusual joyous expression could be noticed on the
visage of Don Gome, which but shortly before was gloomy,
and frequently contracted by anger. The cause of this was,
that the Count de Gormaz, far from receiving, as he feared, a
fresh slight from the king, had met with a kind reception,
which, as he had not anticipated it, doubly pleased him. To
what was due this sudden change in the feelings of the
monarch? It was caused by the endeavours which Diego
Lainez, taking advantage of the mood in which the king was
on that day to grant favours, had used, with the object of
restoring his former friend to the royal favour. The monarch
ultimately had yielded to his solicitations, promising to show
marks of kindness to the grandee De Gormaz, in the presence
of the entire Court. And indeed the king had done so; when
Don Gome had approached him in the saloons of the Alcazar.
Don Fernando had succeeded in concealing his resentment,
and received him with the same kindness which he exhibited
towards Diego Lainez himself.</p>

<p>"Ximena, my daughter!" exclaimed the count, pressing
her in his arms, for he required some means of showing his
content, "the king, despite my calumniators, has remembered
my services, and restored me to his favour. Don Fernando,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
who knows how much I love you,&mdash;that you are the dearest
thing that your father possesses, and that honouring you he
honours me,&mdash;desires to see you, and has commanded me to
lead you to him."</p>

<p>Pleasure, in turn, shone on the countenance of Ximena; it
was not, however, the same kind of pleasure which her father
experienced; it was not that joy which proceeds from satisfied
vanity. The reason for it was, that Ximena loved her father,
although she was well acquainted with his defects, and desired
his happiness, whatever might be the occasion of it. A ray of
hope now brightened up her heart&mdash;the hope that the old
friendly relations between the two families might be renewed,
the consequence of which would be the return of those happy
times when no obstacle was interposed between her and her
lover. Pure and loving souls are as much inclined towards
hope as towards despair; Ximena, therefore, ran over in her
mind, in a brief space of time, those conflicting sentiments,
and passed from darkness to light, from death to life.</p>

<p>Her father then led her into the presence of the king, from
whom, as well as from the queen and the royal children, she
received a most kind reception. The many different experiences,
which she had passed through on that day, had in
no way rendered her less beautiful than usual, and a murmur
of admiration arose amongst the ladies and cavaliers who
were accompanying the royal family when Ximena approached.
De Gormaz smiled with satisfaction and pride; and Diego
Lainez, contemplating for the thousandth time so much
beauty and nobleness of expression, could not help thinking,
"My Rodrigo will be a hero if she commands it; he will gain
a throne if she asks him for one!" And a similar thought
most likely came into the minds of many others, for no one
connected with the Court was ignorant of the old love that
united Ximena and Rodrigo, nor of the influence that the
maiden exercised on the soul of the valiant youth who was
the pride of the family of De Vivar, and the hope of the good
Castilians and Leonese.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">IN WHICH CERTAIN FESTIVITIES ARE DESCRIBED, WHICH
ENDED WITH A BLOW ON A FACE</p></blockquote>


<p>The numerous guests who occupied the saloons of the
Alcazar were devoting themselves, joyously and noisily, to
the various amusements which the magnificent festival provided;
whilst the king and the royal princes were familiarly
conversing with the group of cavaliers that surrounded them;
and the queen and princesses, amidst another group composed
of beautiful women, were amusing themselves also with
pleasant conversation. It could be easily seen, however,
that if the queen devoted most attention to Ximena, the
father of the latter was not obtaining similar favour from the
king, notwithstanding the apparent kindness with which he
had been received only a very short time before. Affection
which does not proceed from the heart cannot long sustain
its fictitious semblance, and, in a moment of forgetfulness, the
mask which conceals it falls off, and the cold visage of indifference
appears. Such was the case with regard to Don
Gome, and, on the other hand, the sincere and wise monarch
was openly showing the real affection which he felt for De
Vivar.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said the king, addressing the cavaliers who
surrounded him, "as a brother I have lamented the death of
Don Garcia, but as a king, obliged to sacrifice the warmest
affections of my heart to the good of the kingdom, which God
has entrusted to me to rule over and govern, I must rejoice
at the victory obtained by the Castilian and Leonese arms at
Atapuerca. In celebrating that glorious triumph I have
given proofs of my munificence to the commoners, my vassals.
It would not be well that the cavaliers who assist at my Court
should be debarred from participating in my favours, according
to their merits. You, noble and loyal Peranzures, I
appoint major-domo of my Alcazar; as you have served my
State so well, with your sword in battle and with your wisdom
at the Court and in the councils, I know you will also faithfully
serve my household. To you, honoured Arias Gonzalo,
I entrust my treasures, feeling sure that they will increase
under your supervision. To you, noble and prudent Diego
Lainez, I confide the care and education of my sons, as I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
sure that, having instructed your own son so well, you will act
similarly with regard to mine. You well know how I love the
princes; placing them in your charge is the greatest proof of
friendship and confidence that a king can give to a subject,
and I now tell you that if I could give you a greater proof I
would heartily do so. You, the most faultless cavalier and
the most honoured and prudent of the grandees of Castile,
will cultivate the talents of my sons, so that the crowns which
one day shall encircle their brows may sit well on them.
God gave me three kingdoms, and I shall leave one to each of
them. You, brave Count de Gormaz, shall be, from to-day,
the General of the Leonese and Castilian troops, in the place
of Diego Lainez and Peranzures, whose arms have been
weakened by age and by the constant wielding of the sword
and lance. You have given me proofs of your courage, fighting
against the Moorish power, and I doubt not but that you, and
the cavaliers who surround you, will serve me well, some by
their valour in battle, and others by their loyalty and wisdom."</p>

<p>Peranzures, Arias Gonzalo, and Diego Lainez bent their
knees and kissed the hand of the king, in order to thank him
for the great favours which he had conferred on them, as was
their duty as good and grateful subjects; De Gormaz, however,
when his turn came, gave loose reins to the anger which
had been accumulating in his heart whilst the other cavaliers
were being thus addressed, especially De Vivar, who appeared
to him to have been unjustly favoured by the king, whose
coldness towards himself he attributed to the evil counsels of
the honoured old man, who indeed was far from deserving
such a suspicion.</p>

<p>"Sire," he said to the king, directing his glances from time
to time towards Diego Lainez, "the Count de Gormaz would
be a fawning courtier, and not an honourable cavalier, if he
were to thank the king for favours which he does not receive.
If flatterers alone please you, do not hope to find one in me."</p>

<p>Another monarch, less prudent than Don Fernando, would
have punished the audacity and ingratitude of Don Gome,
and would have put a bridle on the tongue which had so
rashly spoken; Don Fernando, however, restrained his vexation,
and allowed De Gormaz to express his resentment, even
though it were unjust, and even though he did it in terms
unfitting a subject in the presence of his king.</p>

<p>"You entrust, sire," continued Don Gome, "the education
of your sons to a feeble old man, as if they should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
reared up to be monks, or as if you should desire them to be
as effeminate as women; and, to favour a debilitated flatterer,
you forget, sire, my services and the valour with which I have
always served you! If you desire that the princes should be
good cavaliers, skilful in breaking a lance in a joust, and
daring and prudent in attacking a squadron of Moors, to
whom should you confide their training? Is it to an old man,
whose hand can scarce hold the staff which supports him, or
to me, who have valour in my heart and strength in my arm
to brandish a sword, not only against the infidel, but against
all who dare to doubt the truth of what I say? If there is
any such, I stand prepared to meet him!"</p>

<p>Speaking thus, Don Gome advanced insultingly towards
Diego Lainez, provoking him by his look as well as by his
words.</p>

<p>The old man looked towards the king and curbed his
righteous indignation, which, if it had not been restrained by
the presence of his sovereign, would have burst forth in rage;
if not indeed with the aid of the sword, which his aged hands
could not wield, yet with the voice which could be still
energetic and terrible in defence of an honour which nobody
but the Count de Gormaz had ever dared to cast a slur on;
he then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sire, pardon me if in defending my outraged honour I
pass beyond the limits of the moderation which I should
adhere to in the presence of my lord and king." And he
continued, fixing his gaze on De Gormaz: "Don Gome, you
are unjust in the highest degree if you think that I am a
flatterer and calumniator. Diego Lainez is grateful for the
favours which he receives from his king, but he never tries to
win them, much less by means of flattery and calumny. If
the reasons which you have brought forward, in order to prove
that the king should have entrusted to you, instead of to me,
the education of the princes, have convinced him, to whom I
owe this mark of confidence, I shall renounce in your favour
so great an honour, although I consider it the most signal one
which has been conferred on me during my long life, consecrated
almost entirely to the service of my country. However,
I do not think that those reasons weigh much with the
king. That weakness which you see in my hand, those grey
hairs which you see on my head, and those scars on my face,
only prove that I have lived longer than you, and that I have
not spent my life entirely in the saloons of the Court. If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
can no longer break a lance at a tournament, or enter into
close quarters with a hostile army, I can teach how to do both
one and the other; you, who learned those things from me,
should be able to certify to that, and respect me, if no longer
as an old man, at least as your instructor."</p>

<p>The king recognised the unreasonableness of the count
and the prudence and moderation of De Vivar; he did not
wish, however, to decide publicly in favour of the one or of the
other, for he knew the evils which a complete rupture between
those two noble families would cause to the State, as both of
them were powerful on account of their wealth and the number
of their partisans; therefore, to make the Count de Gormaz an
enemy was a thing which even a monarch might shrink from.
Thus it was that he thought it best to use his influence with a
view to reconciling both opponents, and thus continue in
friendly relations with them.</p>

<p>"Leave aside," he therefore said to them, "those sad contentions,
and think only of renewing the friendship which, in
times not far remote, united you, and of serving your country
and the religion of your forefathers, now continually menaced
by the Moors, for by no other means can good Christian
cavaliers give proof of their loyalty. Both of you are strong
pillars, to support our faith and my throne, and it would never
enter my mind to favour one of you to the prejudice of the
other; indeed, in order to recompense your merits I have
desired that each of you should fill the position which circumstances
necessitate. When De Vivar was robust and
strong enough to wield a lance, he commanded the Christian
armies, and now that he can only serve me by his wisdom and
experience I confide to him a task for which those very qualities
are most necessary. You, Don Gome, are the most
capable of commanding my troops, and therefore I make you
their leader. Some future day you will be old, as Lainez now
is, and then the king will utilise your wisdom and loyalty in
his household. Knowing that you are valiant and take pleasure
in the chances of war, I believed that it would not be
pleasing to you if I appointed you to a position in my Alcazar
which only old men, as Arias, Peranzures, and Lainez are, can
properly fill; or, if not they, only those cavaliers who, on
account of a peaceful nature, are ill suited for battlefields.
Lainez, stretch forth your hand to Don Gome and he will
willingly clasp it."</p>

<p>The old man then held out his feeble hand, as if to seek that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of the count, desirous of pleasing the king, and of sacrificing
his just resentment for the sake of a reconciliation which might
prevent many evils to the State, and which might restore tranquillity
to his household. Perhaps, at that moment, he was
also thinking of Rodrigo, whose happiness depended on the
renewal of friendly relations with De Gormaz. Judge, however,
of his surprise and indignation when he saw the count draw
his hand away, and heard him say in accents full of disdain&mdash;</p>

<p>"The hand of the Count of Gormaz never has clasped and
never shall clasp that of a culumniator."</p>

<p>"Don Gome!" exclaimed the honoured old man, assuming
the haughtiness of a cavalier deeply outraged, "before extending
my hand again to you I would cut it off. You&mdash;you are
the culumniator, whose hand would have stained mine if it
touched it!"</p>

<p>"If it has not stained your hand," exclaimed the count,
"take this, old dotard; it will stain for ever your visage."</p>

<p>And with a blow on the face of the venerable old man he
drew blood&mdash;the blood of Diego Lainez, of him who in former
times was the terror of the Moors, the bravest cavalier of Castile,
the son of Lain Calvo!</p>

<p>"Justice of God!" cried the outraged old man, vainly endeavouring,
such was his weakness, to return the blow of the
coward and avenge the insult which he had received; anger,
however, stopped his voice, clouded his visage, and made his
head so dazed that he fell to the floor.</p>

<p>"Traitor! unworthy knight and bad subject!" exclaimed
the king. "In my presence you dared to raise your hand
against an aged cavalier, who, old as he is, is worth more than
your entire race! As God lives, my executioner shall cut off,
to-morrow, in the public place of Leon, the hand which has
acted in so dastardly and cowardly a manner! My guard
here! My guard here!"</p>

<p>The voice of Don Fernando, however, was lost in the noise
and uproar which arose throughout the saloon. The ladies
uttered terrified cries and fled precipitately into the inner apartments
of the Alcazar, believing that they would find in them a
refuge from the tumult; and the cavaliers, divided into two
parties, one in favour of Don Gome and the other for Diego
Lainez, placed their hands on their swords and broke out into
loud imprecations and threats, without paying any attention to
the presence, to the words, or to the authority of the king
or of the princes. At last Don Fernando succeeded in allay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>ing
the tumult just at the moment when the old man was
rising from the ground. He then clasped him in his arms
and pressed his lips on his cheek, as if to remove from it the
stain which the blow of De Gormaz had imprinted thereon.
His anger being calmed for the time, he was able to reflect,
and the prudent monarch thought that, if he insisted on arresting
De Gormaz then and there, torrents of blood would flow
in the Alcazar and that inextinguishable feuds would blaze up
amongst the flower of the chivalry of Leon and Castile. He
remembered that the grandee De Vivar had numerous champions,
on whom he could rely to avenge such an affront, and
he considered it more prudent to defer the punishment of the
count to a later time. The voice of Diego was then heard in
support of such a decision.</p>

<p>"To Vivar, to my castle!" exclaimed the old man, tearing
his hair, and shedding the first tears which came from his eyes
since he had girded on the sword and buckled on the spurs of
a knight. The outrage inflicted on him had not disturbed his
mind so much that he could not remember what was due to
the dwelling-place of the king, in whose presence no honourable
cavalier could draw his sword to avenge personal insults.</p>

<p>Diego Lainez was obeyed: a few minutes later he was
journeying, in a litter, on the road that led to Vivar, accompanied
by many followers, both on foot and on horseback;
and the halls of the Alcazar became deserted.</p>

<p>The Count de Gormaz had many partisans in Leon, as was
proved by the large number of cavaliers who thronged to his
side when the friends of De Vivar grasped the hilts of their
swords, enraged by the vile offence inflicted on the old man.
However, when the tumult had been appeased, when reflection
forced them to realise on whose side was right, Don Gome
could scarcely have found a cavalier to draw sword in his
defence. It might be said on the following day that, in a few
hours, the count had lost all his friends, for those who had
been hitherto firmly attached to him were now content to
remain neutral with regard to the matter of which everyone
was speaking.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">IN WHICH THE READER WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENED TO
RODRIGO AND HIS SQUIRE BETWEEN LEON AND VIVAR.</p></blockquote>


<p>We have seen Rodrigo quitting the Alcazar precisely at
the time when the pleasures of the ball and the fact of
finding himself amongst the most beautiful women of Leon
and Castile should have made his remaining there exceedingly
agreeable. And whither was he going? What was his
object in departing from the centre of joyousness and pleasure?
The chronicles do not give much information on this occasion,
as on many others, as to the actions of our hero.</p>

<p>The tumult and bustle of the Court were insupportable
to him; his uneasy soul required calm and solitude; he
desired to concentrate his thoughts on one subject alone,
on the love which, the more it was thwarted, the more it
became strong and burning in his heart. What were all those
beautiful women to him, all those elegant and noble cavaliers,
all that delicious music, all those amusements and dances, all
that animation, that life, that gaiety of the Court, if he could
not continue his sweet converse and his love-whisperings with
Ximena&mdash;his love-dreams of love and happiness of a former
time? He had reflected that if he had gone to take leave of
his father, he could not do so without also taking leave of
the king and of the cavaliers who surrounded him, and in that
case they would all have endeavoured to prevent his abandoning
the pleasures of the ball, as it would be impossible for
them to understand his desire and the necessity he felt to be
alone. He therefore returned to the house in which he had
apartments, and mounting a spirited steed, he rode out from
Leon, followed by Fernan Cardeña, a squire, who had formerly
been that of his father and now was his, for the prudent Diego
had transferred him to his son on the eve of the battle of
Atapuerca, in which Rodrigo fought for the first time. He
knew that Fernan, on account of his valour, his joyous and
sprightly disposition, his experience, and above all, his loyalty,
was, amongst all his vassals, the most fitted to accompany and
serve the youth. Speaking strictly, the name of squire could
scarcely be given to Fernan, considering the functions he
performed with regard to Rodrigo, and the duties which were
usually fulfilled by those that bore that name. Fernan was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
reality a companion to Rodrigo; he might be considered as
his military tutor rather than as his squire; and judging by the
arms, both offensive and defensive, which he carried, he might
almost have been mistaken for a cavalier.</p>

<p>The night was calm and beautiful, and a brilliant moon
illumined the country lying around Leon, which was also
enlivened by the shouts of the peasants, still engaged in their
dances, and by their songs and acclamations. Some excited
by the light of the bonfires, some by that of the moon, and
some indeed by the abundant draughts of the juice of the
grape, which they had indulged in, drinking to the health of
Don Fernando, who had shown himself so liberal to everyone
on that memorable day.</p>

<p>"By Judas Iscariot!" said Fernan to himself, "it appears to
me as if they were a band of witches, celebrating their Sabbath
around those bonfires, having bewitched my lord and master.
He, who was always in good humour and fond of conversing
with me on assaults and battles, and of the Moorish dogs
spitted on my lance, does not now seem to care a pin where he
goes or what he sees, and rides on as silent as the dead.
However, it is my opinion that it is that Ximena who has
bewitched him, she whom he intended to marry before the
falling out of Don Gormaz&mdash;may God confound him!&mdash;with
De Vivar, whom I pray God may bless. Certainly that
maiden is a dainty bit, not alone for a hidalgo, but for an
emperor; notwithstanding, I don't see why my master should
so put himself about for any woman, be she noble or simple.
There are many more women than men, for, whilst we go to
the wars and half of us are left there, they, the minxes, remain
peaceably in their homes, waiting till God, who created them,
takes their lives, and the numbers that there are of them everywhere
is becoming a regular plague. Then, if there are two
women for every man, is it not simple nonsense and foolery to
make such a fuss about losing one of them. Oh, how little
would the son of my mother be troubled if he were to lose the
two that fall to his share, for neither of them will let him
enjoy her love, with their jealousies and quarrellings. We
shall arrive at Vivar to-morrow morning, if the pace at which
we are going does not kill our horses, and I swear by the name
I bear, that I will not let Mayorica, the maid of my lady
Doña Teresa, ill-treat and persecute me by her jealousies. For,
if two women fall to the lot of each man, why must one of
them get enraged if he should love the other? By the soul of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Beelzebub, why should I get out of temper on account of such
unreasonable conduct on the part of women? But the selfishness
of my master gives me much pain, and I feel it on my
conscience to divert him a little, for the mind must be distracted
if this tedious journey is to be made any way bearable.
These roads are rougher than those of glory, and this continuous
trot does not conduce to bodily comfort."</p>

<p>Thus reflecting, Fernan applied his long rowelled spurs to
his horse and soon joined his master.</p>

<p>"We have a fine night, sir," he said to him; but Rodrigo
still continued pensive, urged on his steed without intermission,
and did not make any reply.</p>

<p>"We have not yet heard the cock crow at the inns we are
leaving behind us, and our journey is half over; it appears to
me that we might somewhat slacken our pace, for, without
killing ourselves or our horses, we can easily arrive at Vivar
before midday."</p>

<p>Rodrigo did not seem to hear, and Fernan continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"This night reminds me of one on which, being in the
service of your father, we gave good account of a squadron of
Moors who were about setting fire to the harvests in the
country of the Christians."</p>

<p>Rodrigo still continued absorbed in his meditations, but
Fernan was not yet vanquished. He had just touched, without
effect, one of the chords which most easily vibrated in the
heart of his master&mdash;that of war; he now made up his mind
to touch the other&mdash;that of love.</p>

<p>"We shall spend much less time to-night in the journey from
Leon to Vivar, than when you, your father, and I journeyed
from Vivar to Leon, accompanying Doña Ximena."</p>

<p>Rodrigo started on hearing the name of his beloved; and
Fernan, whom the movement did not escape, said to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is certainly Ximena who has bewitched him with those
eyes of hers, which are bright as the morning star. May
Mayorica tear out my eyes when we arrive at Vivar, if it is not
of that maiden he is thinking!"</p>

<p>The good squire was not wrong; the enamoured youth was
thinking of his Ximena, was reflecting on the happiness which
he had enjoyed when at her side, and was considering what
were the probabilities of its being renewed, and of his securing
her for himself.</p>

<p>"How happy," he reflected, "were the days which we passed
near each other, sometimes in my father's mansion at Vivar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
sometimes in that of her father at Gormaz! When we were
children we believed that a tightly tied knot bound us together,
although we were ignorant of its nature; we only knew that we
loved each other and could not cease from loving each
other; we grew up, and with our growth our love increased,
and then we began to feel that we knew the names we
should have to call each other by on some future day.
Who could have told us then that a day would come, when the
union which our dearest hopes and those of our parents looked
forward to, should become little less than impossible? We
were at a tournament once, and when a knight splintered the
lances which he had to break, in order to be proclaimed victor,
Ximena said to me, 'Rodrigo, when you bind on the sword
of a knight, you will combat thus, you will conquer thus; and
thus shall you receive the prize,&mdash;then your glory shall be
mine!' And when the queen of the tournament, seated on a
throne, gilt and adorned with garlands of flowers, presented the
prize to the victor, who knelt at the feet of her whose beauty
was extolled by the noblest and bravest cavaliers, I said to my
Ximena, 'Some day you will be the queen of the tournament
and I the victor, to whom you will hand the prize; all will
applaud you and admire your beauty, and your glory will
increase that which the victory shall bring to me.' At other
times, swift as the butterflies and joyous as the birds, running
through the gardens which surrounded the castle of your father
or of mine, or seated under the shade of the trees in the woods,
casting flowers into the stream which rushed by them in its
rapid course, or standing together on the ramparts of the
castle, gazing on the clear azure of the sky, and breathing the
perfume of the fields which the fresh breezes of the night bore
towards us, we dreamt of a life of love, of glory, and of almost
heavenly happiness."</p>

<p>At this point of his reflections Rodrigo Diaz had arrived,
when Fernan interrupted him, pronouncing the name of
Ximena. They spoke for some moments of the day to which
the squire referred; however, as the youth did not consider it
prudent to give him any explications regarding his love affairs,
and as he could not well talk of matters therewith connected,
without having to refer to them, he changed the conversation.
Finding that he had to talk of something, as he saw that the
squire was resolved not to remain silent, he reverted to the
subject which he thought would please him, and began to talk
of the wars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Fernan, who of the six-and-thirty years which he counted
had passed twenty on fields of battle, distracted the attention
of his master completely from his amorous meditations. He
related to him many wonderful events, which the chronicler, to
whom we owe much of what we are relating, considered, for
the most part, pure fables, but which Rodrigo evidently believed,
becoming at times very enthusiastic, and breaking out into
such exclamations as&mdash;"Ah! Moorish dogs!... By St.
James! that lance thrust was worth a king's treasure!...
God's anger! what a caitiff was that knight!&mdash;Oh that someone
had been there to cut off the wretch's head!"&mdash;and
others of a similar kind.</p>

<p>About this time morning began to dawn, and the birds to
sing in the trees which overhung the road. Our travellers
arrived at an inn, called the Sign of the Moor. Fernan
advised his master to dismount there, with a view to strengthening
a little the stomachs of both riders and horses. Rodrigo
assented, as he considered that, if love had taken away his
appetite, the case was different with regard to his squire and
the tired beasts.</p>

<p>They were just dismounting when they heard a noise, as of
horses, in a dark grove which was opposite the inn, and almost
at the same time they heard a voice which called out to
them&mdash;</p>

<p>"To my rescue, cavaliers!"</p>

<p>"Halt, villains! for such ye are!" cried Rodrigo, grasping
his sword and preparing to attack the strangers.</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub!" shouted Fernan, "do not
touch them; your sword should not be used against this crew
of bandits, for such they must be, and moreover rustics from
this neighbourhood. You shall see what my lance can do
with them."</p>

<p>Saying this, Fernan rushed on the men who were in the
wood. His master did not accompany him, as he felt that he
should not use a knight's sword, for the first time, in a fight
with miserable highway robbers&mdash;the sword with which he had
been girt, only the day before, by the King of Castile and Leon.</p>

<p>Whilst Fernan was fighting in the wood with those whom
he considered bandits, overthrowing each with a thrust of his
strong lance, one of them separated himself from his companions
and rode rapidly to the inn. When he reached it he
dismounted hastily, gave a terrible blow to the door, which
caused it to fly into fragments, and entered, issuing forth, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
instant after, carrying another person, who appeared to be a
woman. He leaped on his horse with her, spurred it violently,
and just then, Rodrigo, who stood observing the scene, heard
a voice which cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"For the sake of God, sir knight, save a maiden who has
been torn away from her parents by those miserable ruffians!"</p>

<p>Rodrigo believed now that the occasion had arrived,
when he could fulfil one of the duties imposed on him by the
oath he had sworn when he was made a knight, which was to
defend the weak and oppressed; and, placing his hand on his
sword, he closed with the abductor, who, in his turn, drew his
weapon, holding with his left hand both the bridle of his horse
and the young girl. The combat was fierce and obstinate;
the disadvantage caused to the unknown by having to hold
his prey was equalised by the caution which Rodrigo had to
use, in order not to wound her whom he was endeavouring to
save; and, moreover, the leafy trees dulled the early morning's
light. The gallop of a horse was then heard, which was
coming in the direction of the combatants; the bandit turned
his head by an instinctive movement, doubtless to see if it
were one of his companions coming to his aid, and just at
that moment the brave youth thrust his sword through the
neck-piece of his armour, causing him to fall to the ground,
pouring forth a stream of blood, and dragging down with him
the maiden, who had just fainted.</p>

<p>At that moment Fernan arrived, brandishing his heavy
lance.</p>

<p>"Well done, sir! well done, I swear!" exclaimed the valiant
squire, when he saw that his master had triumphed over his
adversary. "You are worthy of your father, and have given
good handsel to your sword; for, as far as I can see, those
traitors were abductors of women. Be off to hell, villain," he
continued, turning towards the vanquished man; "in the wood
two of your comrades lie biting the dust, and you will be able
to make the journey in love and good fellowship."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, both the knight and the squire dismounted,
in order to aid the girl. She was, to judge by her dress, a
country maiden, and very beautiful. They bore her to the inn,
the owners of which were much rejoiced to see her free from
her persecutors; for, even though they were not strong enough
to succour her, they knew that she must have been carried
away by force. Thanks, now, to the cares lavished on her by
the innkeeper and his wife, the knight, and the squire, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
regained consciousness in a short time, and falling on her
knees before the brave youth who had rescued her, she
warmly expressed her gratitude, shedding tears all the time.
They did their utmost to console her, and, as it did not appear
prudent to Rodrigo to leave her in the inn, exposed to the
danger of again falling into the hands of those of her abductors
who had escaped the lance of Fernan, he made up his mind
to bring her to Vivar, where she might recruit her health,
which had been seriously impaired in a few hours. The
maiden willingly assented, and when the squire and the
horses had partaken of a hasty meal, they assisted her to
mount on the steed of the man who was lying there, apparently
dead, and they all set out on the road to Vivar, just as the sun
was rising in the east, and the labourers and muleteers, coming
from all quarters, were lending life and animation to the
country, solitary till then, with their joyous songs and friendly
talks.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">IN WHICH THE MAIDEN, IN ADDITION TO HER OWN STORY,
RELATES CERTAIN MATTERS, WHICH WILL ROUSE THE
ANGER OF THOSE WHO READ OF THEM</p></blockquote>


<p>"My master will be glad to know how you happened to
fall into the power of those ruffians," said Fernan to the
girl, when they had rode a short distance from the inn,
not being able to restrain the curiosity, which was also felt by
Rodrigo, although the image of Ximena was not for a moment
absent from his mind.</p>

<p>"I shall do so with much pleasure, courteous squire,"
replied the maiden; "for if the knowledge that I was
forcibly carried away has been sufficient to induce this good
knight to run to my succour, he will feel better pleased for
having performed that kind action when he shall have learned
more of my misfortunes."</p>

<p>"Relate them to us, relate them to us," said Rodrigo,
impatient to hear the adventures of his protégée, whose
gentleness and beauty had much struck him.</p>

<p>The young girl hastened to comply, saying, "God gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
me very honourable parents, although their position was only
that of peasants, and I always dwelt with them at Carrion, in
this neighbourhood. They were vassals of Don Suero, and
although continually crushed down by the exactions of the
count, demanding constantly contributions from them, in which
went the greater part of the fruits of their toil, they nevertheless
lived contented; for the love which my parents had
for each other made all their troubles bearable, and even
sweet. I was born, the sole fruit of their marriage, and they
loved me with such tenderness that, if I were removed from
their side, life would have no charm left for them. To relate
all the care they lavished on me, until I completed my
fourteenth year, would be a never-ending story; I believe
that the poor love better than the rich, for, since love is one
of the pleasures, and perhaps the only one, which is not
forbidden them, they devote themselves to it with all the
strength of their souls. Poor as they were, my parents
managed to give me an education much better than is usually
received by girls of my position. Whether it was for that
reason, or on account of the great care with which my mother
guarded me, it is certain that I was always preferred to my
companions by the young men, when we danced on the
threshing-floors on Sunday evenings, when they sang in our
praise under the windows, and when they returned from the
woods with branches covered with May bloom, which they
stuck in the ground near the doors of the houses. Near our
house lived a young man, named Martin, who, amongst all
those of his age, distinguished himself by the affection which
he manifested for me, and by his many good qualities,
especially by his kindly disposition and his valour. For my
part, I grew to love him very much, as also did my parents;
having demanded from them my hand, as he knew that my
heart was his, they willingly assented, and the day of our
marriage was arranged. You cannot know how much Don
Suero was hated in the district, both by the nobles and by the
country-people, on account of his tyranny as well as of his
evil life, the report of which more than once reached the ears
of the king. He, however, had not found an opportunity to
punish him, as Don Suero is as powerful as he is cunning and
daring. Not far from Carrion, in a valley covered with
gloomy woods, there is a sanctuary to which, every year, the
inhabitants of the country, for twenty miles round, go on a
pilgrimage; and there they indulge in dances, banquets, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
other amusements suitable for such festivals. This pilgrimage
takes place in the pleasantest part of spring, and the rustic
festivities render the joining in it very delightful. Early in
the morning my parents, Martin, his parents, and I set out
from Carrion, and, having arrived at the sanctuary and
visited it with devotion, we retired to refresh ourselves by
taking a meal and a rest under the shade of the trees, seated
on the grassy sod, that was sprinkled over with flowers, which
delighted us with their beauty and perfume. When our
frugal but savoury repast was finished, a poor blind man
approached us, playing a lute. We gave him what remained
of our meal, which he thankfully accepted, also a draught of
wine, which put him in good spirits. We then asked him to
play his instrument, in order that Martin and I might dance
to its music. The blind man did as we requested him,
and we danced with much pleasure both to ourselves and to
our parents, who warmly applauded us. Many persons
approached, forming a circle round us; but suddenly the
trampling of horses was heard, and all turned towards the
path from whence the sounds proceeded, and then we all
trembled when we saw the Count, Don Suero, who was riding
on, not far from us, with a brilliant company of pages and
cavaliers, and who kept his gaze riveted on me with an
attention which terrified me. The blind man let his instrument
fall on the ground when he heard the name of Don
Suero, and began to tremble in such a way that those who
were standing around felt compassion for him. He endeavoured
to conceal himself amongst them, as if the eyes of
the count were those of a basilisk, and he feared lest they
might gaze on him. The crowd dispersed as soon as the
music and the dancing, which had attracted them, ceased;
Don Suero and his attendants continued their way, and
shortly after our inquietude had almost disappeared. But
not so with the blind man, who remained there full of terror,
listening to the slightest noise which could be heard about us.
We asked him what was the cause of his inquietude, and
this is the lamentable story which he related to us, from
time to time shedding copious tears: 'God, when He took
my wife from me, left me a daughter, and also my eyes, with
which I could gaze upon her beauty, for you cannot imagine
how beautiful my Sancha was! Poor and rich envied me my
treasure, for gold and silver and palaces could not be of so
much value to me as my daughter. "Father," she used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
say to me, "you are the centre of my affections on earth."
"Daughter," I used to say to her, "you will be my glory in
this world." Such was I to her, and such was she to me.
One day we saw from our window a cavalier, who, riding
across the fields which I cultivated, was directing his way
towards our happy abode. He came up to the door and
asked for a drink of water, for it was the month of July and
the sun was so burning that Sancha and I had returned
home from our work, in order to escape his rays. My
daughter handed the water to him, and we invited him to rest
beneath our roof. The cavalier thanked us, but did not
accept our offer. "You have been hospitable to me," he said,
"and I desire to show you that I am grateful; in exchange
for the kindness you offer me I ask another from you; if at
any time you should go to Carrion, where my estates are, come
to the castle which I have there, and I shall be well pleased
to see both of you and extend my hospitality to you; if you
do not so, I shall be much vexed, for it will prove that you
do not trust in my goodwill, as I do in yours." We promised
to do as he requested, if the occasion should arise, and the
cavalier went off by the way he came, leaving us delighted
with his courtesy, and resolved to comply with his wishes,
if ever we should be in the vicinity of Carrion. The opportunity
came, and it appeared to us that it would be an act of
discourtesy if we were to return home without seeing the
count, for the offering of a favour is of more worth than the
acceptance of it. We proceeded to his castle, and Don Suero
received us and entertained us, not as peasants, which we are,
but as if we were kings. He showed us his magnificent
apartments, his richly-wrought furniture, brocades and
tapestries worthy of an emperor, gold and silver vessels, and
beds covered with silk and gold. My Sancha saw damsels
there clad like queens. None of them were as beautiful as
she was, but appeared so on account of the richness of their
apparel and the fairness of their faces, not browned, like hers,
by the rays of the sun in summer and the cold blasts of
winter. When so great riches and such luxuries had made
us lament secretly the misery in which we always had lived,
without noticing it until then, the count asked us if we
would like to remain in his palace, where a happy life would
await us, compared with that which we had experienced, and
which we should in future experience, working in the fields.
Little would have made us accept his proposal, but my Sancha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and I had heard that ambition, flattery, and calumny, which
destroy both body and soul, reside in palaces, and we resisted
the temptation and the importunities of Don Suero. We took
leave of him, expressing our thanks; but, on reaching the
gate of the castle, we found it shut, and when we were
about to call out for someone to open it, two servants of
the count seized on me, and two men on my daughter, and
separated us, carrying us off with violence, Sancha I know
not whither, and me into a dark prison cell. In vain
I implored them, in vain I called the count by the
name of traitor, in vain I questioned my jailers, for I remained
many months in my cell, separated from the world,
and without a ray of light falling on my eyes. From time to
time I heard the bolts of my dungeon, and a person&mdash;I know
not whether it was a man or woman, for the darkness was
always complete, and no voice, except my own, ever sounded&mdash;brought
to me the meagre food which prolonged my sad life.
One day I took up the vessel in which water was left for me
and raised it to my lips; I found in it a sweetish liquor, which
I drank without distrust; in a short time I felt a great heaviness
coming over my entire body, my senses were numbed, my
eyelids closed, and in a few moments I fell into a heavy sleep.
That sleep must have lasted very long, or at least so it seemed
to me, on account of the torments I suffered during its continuance;
at first there was a horrible nightmare, during which,
at one time, my daughter appeared calling on me, in her
desolation, to deliver her from the count; at another, weeping,
in despair, over her lost honour; after that I felt an acute pain
in my head, as if my eyes were being torn out, and I thought
I heard footsteps of persons moving about me. At last I
shook off that infernal sleep; my senses recovered their
activity, and I only then felt a great weariness over my entire
body, and an agonising pain in my eyes. I raised my hand to
them and found my face bathed with a liquid, which I thought
was sweat. A terrible suspicion seized on me at that moment:
I feared that they had deprived me for ever of the light,
and the pain which I felt in my eyes for some days confirmed
that idea. From that time forth I desired more ardently than
ever to be able to leave my prison, in order to find out if my
suspicions were correct, if I were condemned to live for ever
in darkness; and I incessantly demanded my liberty from my
jailer, who at last, speaking to me for the first time, informed
me that I was about to receive my liberty. He then took me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
by the hand, and guiding me through some winding passages,
left me in a place, which appeared to me to be a field, for
the air was circulating freely; the rustling of the leaves,
moving over the ground, could be heard; my feet trod on
a soft substance, which I knew to be grass; and the murmurings
of the fountains and brooks arrived to my ears.
Then&mdash;ay, then! a despairing cry escaped my lips; there was
no longer any doubt, the Count of Carrion had condemned me
to perpetual darkness; the sun, the sky, the verdure of the
fields, and above all, the dangerous beauty with which God
had endowed my daughter&mdash;my beloved Sancha&mdash;could never
again be seen by me! "But what has become of her, my
God!" I exclaimed. "Where shall I find her? Where is she,
that she does not come to guide her poor blind father in the
darkness which will perpetually surround him?" And from
that time to this I seek my daughter everywhere, in the
villages and in the cities, in palaces and in cabins&mdash;and
nowhere can I find her. A hundred times have I gone to
Don Suero to demand of him where she is, and he has always
ordered his servants to drive me with blows from his palace,
and now I fear to go near him again, for he would kill me, and
I do not wish to die until I have clasped my daughter in my
arms, and found a cavalier who will avenge the terrible injuries
which have been inflicted on us.'"</p>

<p>"God's anger! what a wretch that count is!" exclaimed
Rodrigo, when the girl had related thus far, and to whom he
had listened with visible emotion. "I would give my life," he
continued, "to prove against him the temper of my sword;
and I pray God to grant me an opportunity of doing so."</p>

<p>"In such a way did Martin cry out," continued the maiden,
"when the blind man terminated his sad history. You could
have seen him, sir knight, clenching his strong hands, brandishing
the stout stick which he used as a staff, and following
with his eyes the road on which, but a few minutes before,
the count had disappeared, as if seeking that infamous
cavalier, in order to crush him with his righteous anger."</p>

<p>"I vow by Judas Iscariot," exclaimed Fernan, not less
indignant than his master, "that if I can get my lance near
that villainous wretch, I will spit him on it like a hen, not
alone in the presence of the King of Leon and Castile, but
even in that of the King of Heaven Himself. But continue
your narrative, fair maid, for both my master and I are most
anxious to hear the conclusion of your own adventure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>The maiden then returned to what concerned herself, and
the knight and the squire approached their steeds as near hers
as they possibly could, so as not to miss a word of what she
might say.</p>

<p>"The sun was about to hide himself behind a distant hill;
and the birds were bidding him farewell, singing plaintively
in the trees which surrounded us; and the pilgrims were
beginning to leave the sanctuary, as their songs and their
joyous cries could be heard on the various roads which
branched off in all directions. We took the one which led to
Carrion, and the blind man with the lute was to get a night's
lodging in the hermitage. His story had taken gladness from
our hearts, and we were walking on, silent and uneasy, as if
we foresaw some misfortune. Night had come on, and the
moon was alternately lighting up the landscape and hiding
herself behind the large black clouds which were moving
across the sky. On entering a narrow road, bordered by thick
trees, we perceived, in the obscurity, some dark objects which
appeared to us to be men on horseback, and we were not
wrong, for just then they advanced to meet us, calling out to
us, 'Halt, ye rustics, or whoever ye are.' Martin recognised
the voice as that of one of the servants of Don Suero, and told
me so, placing himself before me, as if to protect me from a
danger which he believed was threatening me. Two of the
horsemen dismounted and came towards me with drawn
swords; the moon then concealed herself behind a dark cloud,
and a terrific fight took place between the ruffians and Martin,
whose father, together with my father, ran to his aid, although
they were armed even worse than he was. At last, however,
the combat ceased; but the darkness prevented me from seeing
what had happened to Martin and our fathers. One of the
ruffians then lifted me up in his strong arms, without my being
able to resist him, as terror had deprived me of all strength,
and placed me in those of one of the men who had not dismounted;
he then, placing me before him on the horse, gave
it the spurs and galloped off, followed by his comrades, not, as
I judged, by the road towards Carrion, but to a castle situated
at the boundaries of the district.</p>

<p>"He who had carried me off was Don Suero, whom I afterwards
saw lying insensible before the Inn of the Moor. An
hour before your arrival we all dismounted at that hostelry, for
the ride had been rapid and long, and both riders and horses
were almost exhausted by hunger and fatigue. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
when they were about to resume their journey, the footsteps of
your steeds were heard, and Don Suero, shutting me up in a
room, sallied forth with his followers to meet you. You know
now, sir knight, how grateful I should be for the service you
have rendered me; but, even if saved from my abductor, I
cannot but weep for my father and for the brave youth to
whom I was to have been married, and of whose fate I am
ignorant, as they are of mine."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the girl gave vent to her tears, which even
the kind words of Rodrigo and his squire were unavailing to
restrain.</p>

<p>Not long after this the battlements of the Castle of Vivar were
seen in the distance, and when the sun had about half finished
his daily journey our travellers arrived at the end of theirs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW RODRIGO AND HIS SQUIRE WERE RECEIVED
AT VIVAR</p></blockquote>


<p>The first care of Rodrigo on entering his paternal mansion
was to entrust the young girl to the care of his
mother's servant-women, and they, knowing how necessary
rest was for her, prepared a comfortable bed, in which we shall
leave her to her repose, in order to describe the reception
which his mother gave to the newly-made knight, and which
his sweetheart gave to Fernan.</p>

<p>Rodrigo had now been separated from his mother for many
months. Being ignorant of the customs of the Court&mdash;as he
had scarcely ever been absent from Vivar, except when visiting
the estates of Don Gome or attending some tournament in the
vicinity&mdash;his father brought him to it, in order that he might
become acquainted with its usages and learn all that a young
man, who would soon, most likely, be made a knight, should
know.</p>

<p>Teresa Nuña was a lady in whom were to be found all the
virtues and good qualities that one could desire in a woman.
The nobility of her race, and her prudence and beauty gave
her a right to shine in the royal Court, but her ambition from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the time she was a child was of a different kind. All the
glory and all the delights of the world were, for her, only to be
found at the domestic hearth; to love her family, to be loved
in return, and to be the guardian angel of the weak and of the
poor&mdash;these were the objects of her ambition, these were her
greatest delights, these were her supreme desires. At the time
when she was born it was usual for girls who, like Teresa,
looked with disdain on worldly riches and the pleasures of
love, to bury themselves in a cloister; nevertheless, although
her faith was as pure and as holy as that which, five centuries
later, inflamed the soul of another Teresa, the singer of divine
love,&mdash;even though she may not have participated in the same
religious ecstasies as that saint,&mdash;Teresa Nuña entertained
different views. She considered that the cloister should be
the asylum of the unfortunate, a refuge for hearts which looked
for nothing but heaven, the dwelling of those who could do
but little for the cause of humanity. To make the happiness
of an honoured husband, to give to her country sons who
might be an honour to it and defend it, to cover with the
mantle of charity and mercy the nakedness and the misery of
the unfortunate&mdash;these things were in her mind the holiest
duties of a woman. For something more than singing to
heaven the psalms of the poet-king, through the bars placed
across the window of a cell, did God place the woman by the
side of the man,&mdash;woman, that weak, beautiful, sweet, persuasive
being, full of charity, all spirit, all poetry. God, who
causes sweet-smelling flowers to spring up in the midst of the
foul marshes, and the herbs to grow on the hard rock, in order
that the odour of their flowers may neutralise the fetid smell
of the marsh, and the soft leaves the asperity of the stone;
God, we repeat, has placed the woman at the side of the man
in order that the sweetness of the one nature may neutralise
the asperity of the other. When a woman's heart is broken
by a man, or when he refuses her the shield which should
protect her weakness, let her seek in God that which he has
taken from her or refused to her, and woe to them that deny
to her such a refuge; however, where reasons for shutting
herself up in a cloister do not exist, let her fulfil in the world
her glorious destiny. Thus thought Teresa Nuña when the
brave and honoured Diego Lainez besought her hand; she
gave it to him with joy, for by doing so the honour of her
house would be increased, and, above all, her noble aspirations
would find their realisation. From that time forward she was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
more than ever before, the mother of the unfortunate; and
when nature gave her another right to that sweet name, when
she was called such by the rosy lips of her child, she considered
herself the happiest woman in this world. It is easy,
then, to imagine the love she felt for Rodrigo, she whose heart
was a treasure of love and tenderness for all, and the pleasure
she would feel in again clasping to her heart that handsome
and gentle youth after some months of separation from him.
He had scarcely dismounted in the courtyard of the castle
when she ran to meet him, and both were reunited in a close
embrace.</p>

<p>"How is it, my son," asked Teresa of the youth, "that your
father has not come with you, for had he done so my happiness
would be complete?"</p>

<p>"Do not be uneasy, dear mother," replied Rodrigo; "last
night I left him well, and much honoured by the king, at Leon,
to which city Don Fernando has returned."</p>

<p>"I am rejoiced, son of my soul, on account of the affection
which Don Fernando feels for your father, and the favours
which he confers on him; however, I would be more rejoiced
if I could have him always by my side, for if the love which I
always had for him made me weep during his absence when
he was still vigorous and young, it makes me doubly sad when
he is away from me now that he is feeble and old. I fear that
the disquietudes of a Court life may injure his health, or that he
may be injured by the plots which his rivals and enemies get
up against him."</p>

<p>"As to that, have no fear, mother. Our rivals know that,
even if the hand of Diego Lainez is weak to avenge injuries, it
is not so with that of his son. Who will dare to insult Diego,
now that a knight's sword has been girt on Rodrigo?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my son!" exclaimed Teresa, again embracing the
youth, full of delight, as much for the generous impulse which
the words of her son manifested as for the news that he had
been made a knight. "How is it that the eyes of your mother
did not sooner notice your sword-belt? When, my son, were
you so honoured?"</p>

<p>"Only yesterday, dear mother, and much honoured indeed,
for the king girt on my sword, the queen gave me my steed,
and the Infanta Doña Urraca buckled on my spurs."</p>

<p>"Oh, how great an honour you will become to the order into
which you have been received!"</p>

<p>"Such, I trust, shall be soon, mother; for I only come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
take leave of you before setting out for the frontiers to fight
against the Moorish power; for oh, my mother, I want riches,
I want a throne!"</p>

<p>"I well can understand those noble aspirations, as the blood
of the Counts of Castile flows in your veins. Proceed, then, to
the war, even though parting from you will make your mother's
heart bleed, as I would wish to keep you always near me.
However, let no ambition dazzle you, beyond that of serving
your country and the faith of your forefathers. You say that
you desire riches, that you desire a throne. Why do you
desire a throne, my son?"</p>

<p>"I desire it, dear mother, in order to raise myself above
that ambitious count, who looks on me as one too poor and
humble to merit the hand of his daughter."</p>

<p>"Ah, my son, you have then not yet conquered that love,
the realising of which has become almost an impossibility, and
which has caused such inquietudes both in your soul and in
those of your parents? You have not yet forgotten Ximena?"</p>

<p>"Forget her? forget her? Never, my mother! In vain
have I tried to do so; in vain have I sought to erase her
image from my heart; in vain have I tried to think that to love
Ximena was almost the same as to humble myself before her
father, a humiliation unworthy of the race of Vivar; but this
love still dominates me, stronger and more vigorous than ever.
Forget her? forget her? Had I but loved her a day, a
month, a year, and not almost during my whole life; were
Ximena and I the maiden and the youth, whose union might
appease paternal rancours or satisfy paternal ambitions, and in
which love had little part; were she less beautiful, less discreet,
less honoured than she is&mdash;then perhaps I could forget her; but
you, my mother, know how deep is the love which unites us;
for you, whose eyes were ever fixed on us, have seen it spring
up and increase, and you have even fanned its flame by
keeping us ever near each other, and by letting us see the
pleasure and the pride which a similar love caused you. I
promised you, indeed, when I left your arms to betake myself
to the Court, that I would endeavour to forget her, and I even
said to you that I had hopes that I might be able to do so;
but I was mistaken, dear mother. Many days passed without
my seeing her, but none that I did not think on her; and that
day on which my father brought me with him to the Court
was the happiest of my life, and proved to me that separation
had only made our love stronger. Had you seen her eclipsing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
with her beauty that of the fairest dames of Leon, and receiving
the homage of the bravest and best cavaliers, you could not
ask me, mother, Have you forgotten her?"</p>

<p>Teresa was now convinced, if indeed she had not already
been so, that the love of her son was above all reasonings, and
she did not try to overcome it with hers. She thought it better,
therefore, to endeavour to remove the pain from his burning
heart by pouring on it some drops of the balsam of hope.</p>

<p>"Do not forget her, then, my son," she said to the excited
youth, caressing him with her hand, and with a look full of
love and tenderness. "This love will elevate your soul and
strengthen your heart. Summon our friends and vassals, and
go fight against the infidel, for the glory and the power which
you will achieve shall throw into the shade, as you have said,
the ambitious Don Gome, and Ximena will become your bride.
The contentions which separate her family and ours are not
of that kind which, between honourable rivals, cannot be terminated
without honour being stained. Go, my Rodrigo, go
to your repose, for indeed you require it after so long a
journey, and to-morrow we shall see what can be done to promote
your happiness; for your mother, more experienced than
you in the affairs of this world, will aid you with her love and
advice."</p>

<p>Teresa and her son again lovingly embraced each other, and
the youth retired to take off his armour in order to seek repose;
not, however, without having related to her the adventure at
the Inn of the Moor, and having recommended to her care the
maiden who had sought the hospitality of the castle.</p>

<p>Having described the reception which was given to Rodrigo
at Vivar, we must also describe that which Fernan received.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time that our travellers rode into the
courtyard of the castle, there entered after them a large
number of girls and young men, vassals of the grandee of Vivar,
who, having seen Rodrigo arrive, and having recognised, by his
armour, that he was now a knight, came to welcome him and
offer him their congratulations on account of the order of
chivalry which he had received, playing rustic instruments and
singing joyous songs. As soon as Rodrigo dismounted he
ascended to the upper apartments, leaving the young girl, his
guest, with his squire, in order that he might place her under
the care of the servants of his mother, as we have already mentioned.
Fernan then proceeded to the stables, to see that the
horses were properly attended to. When he returned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
courtyard the male and female peasants began to pour in, and
amongst the latter he saw one so graceful and pretty that he
would have fallen in love with her at once, if his heart had not
been captured beforehand, by her charms. As it was a long
time since he had seen her, he forgot where he was, and running
up to her, gave her a warm embrace, which the girl did
not try to avoid, as she was rather fond of the brave squire,
and love, particularly amongst country-people, often goes
beyond the bounds of decorum. At that very moment
Mayorica heard the music and the cheering in the courtyard;
she ran to her window, which looked out on it, and was much
enraged, with good cause, when she saw Fernan so warmly
embracing the peasant girl. "Ah, traitor!" she exclaimed;
and when he heard that cry, the squire let go the girl, who,
uttering another cry, suddenly ran off from her companions and
from the castle, not without threatening both with her look and
hand the unlucky Fernan, who did not notice this, however,
on account of the perturbation of his mind.</p>

<p>The good squire remained as if thunderstruck for some
moments, but he soon recovered his habitual serenity, and
began to consider, whilst ascending the stairs, what he should
do to escape the strong language and, perhaps, the nails of
Mayorica.</p>

<p>"What a fool I am," he said to himself, "not to be able to
restrain my impetuous feelings, when prudence should counsel
me to do so!" and he tugged at his hair out of pure vexation
with himself. "A fool, and ten times a fool," he continued,
"not to remember the unreasonableness of women. O ye
women, cause of all my troubles! but it was I myself, donkey
that I am, that was the cause of the present one. Why do I
not cast both of you off, or turn Moor, so as to have three, and
none of them to tear my beard if I love the others. But I
am an old Christian, and have fought long years against the law
of Mahomet and must fight against it still; however, for all
that, I cannot deny that Mahomet was a wise man, in one
thing at least&mdash;permitting a man to have three wives. I would
not only allow three but three hundred, so that none of them
could claim more than the three-hundredth part of a man's love.
A man returns home, after a long journey, sore and weary,
and instead of finding a woman to welcome him with open
arms, he finds a regular fury, who receives him with abuse
and with scratches enough to blind him."</p>

<p>With these wise reflections Fernan ascended the stairs, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
entering the chamber of Mayorica, he found her, bathed in tears,
sitting on a chair, in such a condition that it awoke compassion
to see her. Such, then, did our squire feel, and as pity
is said to be akin to love, his returned in such a degree that
his angry thoughts were well-nigh forgotten.</p>

<p>"Who has offended you, Mayorica of my soul?" exclaimed
Fernan, approaching the damsel with open arms; but she
suddenly arose, and seizing, with great fury, the squire by the
neck, cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, traitor, and worse than traitor! I will choke you, so
that you may never more deceive honourable girls who are
worth more than your whole race."</p>

<p>"I vow by Judas Iscariot! by the soul of Beelzebub!"
muttered Fernan with stifled voice, struggling to get free from
his enraged sweetheart. "Let go, let go, you vixen, or I shall
make you do so, even if I have to strike you."</p>

<p>And making a violent effort, he found himself free from the
young woman, whom he pushed from him across the floor,
though he did not do so before getting some scratches on his
face.</p>

<p>Mayorica, knowing that her nails were insufficient weapons to
fight against so robust a lover, had recourse to the usual one
of women, that is, to her tongue, and Fernan to a similar one, as
he considered it was not courteous and honourable to fight
with stronger weapons, especially when his adversary was a
woman.</p>

<p>"Woe is me! who, having refused the love even of hidalgos,
have kept my honour intact for the sake of such a low-born
squire, a greater traitor than Judas himself!" cried Mayorica,
bursting out again into torrents of tears, that would have
softened a stone.</p>

<p>Fernan laid aside his annoyance and endeavoured to conquer
the anger of his sweetheart with mild reasoning, for his
heart was as soft as wax when dealing with women, as it was
hard as flint before his enemies on the field of battle. And
besides, what should a man do but humble himself before a
woman who at thirty years of age&mdash;for Mayorica was not a day
younger&mdash;comes with unstained honour to a man, in order that
he may claim her as his own?</p>

<p>"Be quiet, be quiet, Mayorica of my soul! I always look
on you as my own, and I have always loved you, and ever will
love you," he interrupted, with endearing accents and an
affectionate gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, you villain!" replied the young woman, "it was not
enough for you to act the traitor but you must also come to
me with lies in your mouth. You then want to deny what my
very eyes have witnessed?"</p>

<p>"Let not that pain you, Mayorica; with my arms I did not
give my heart to that peasant girl, Aldonza; I keep it always
for you."</p>

<p>"Be off, traitor! your ridiculous excuses enrage me more
than they appease me. Depart from me, and never, as long
as you live, dare to look on me again with eyes of affection."</p>

<p>It appeared to Fernan that the anger of Mayorica was lasting
much too long; thus it was that, his patience failing him, he
determined to make use of his arithmetical argument, and if
he could not succeed in convincing her with it, to renounce
the attempt, and even, if necessary, his love itself.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he said, "I am fond of Aldonza, but, I swear
to you, of no other but you and her. I have told you a
thousand times that, according to my calculations, there are
two women in Spain for every man. Is it not nonsense, then,
to blame me for only claiming what belongs to me, when I go
no farther?"</p>

<p>"Be off with you, shameless wretch!" exclaimed Mayorica, at
the height of her exasperation.</p>

<p>"Yes, and at once," said Fernan; "for Aldonza is awaiting
me, in order to repay with interest the embrace I gave her."</p>

<p>Saying this, he quitted the chamber of Mayorica and went off
to his own, muttering on his way&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub, how this nonsense, this
obstinacy, this absurdity of women, makes my blood boil! I
will rest myself to-night, for I need to do so, and to-morrow I
will compensate myself with Aldonza for the ingratitude of
Mayorica. That girl is affectionate and not cross and quarrelsome,
like the vixen I have just left."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW FERNAN DESPAIRED OF GETTING WOMEN TO UNDERSTAND
REASON, AND HOW DIEGO LAINEZ HOPED THAT
HIS HONOUR WILL BE AVENGED</p></blockquote>


<p>Morning began to break when a cross-bowman, who was
keeping watch on the battlements of the Castle of Vivar,
heard the trampling of horses at a short distance from
the fortifications, and a moment after he saw advancing a
body of horsemen and also men on foot, who seemed to
bear a litter. He put to his mouth the speaking-trumpet
which hung from his neck, and cried out, "Who goes there?"
Those who were approaching answered by a signal, which he
evidently understood, as the bridges and the portcullis were at
once lowered, and the cortège entered the courtyard.</p>

<p>A short time before Fernan had left the castle by an iron-bound
door, which led to the stables and which was used for
the egress and ingress of the servants of the lords of Vivar,
especially in the night-time, when the principal entrance was
defended by a double portcullis and a gate, too heavy to raise
frequently.</p>

<p>Whither was the squire going so early in the morning?
It is easy to guess, if we remember the last words he used
when retiring to rest a few hours before. Notwithstanding his
quarrel with Mayorica, he had slept that night like a dead man,
until an early hour of the morning, at which time he awoke,
as was his custom, and hastened off to the dwelling of Aldonza,
for she lived at some distance, and he had to be back in the
castle before his master arose, when he should have to be in
attendance on him. We must, however, tell who the girl was
whom he was about to visit, and also who the old woman was
with whom she lived. To do this it is only necessary to copy
literally the words of the chronicler, who writes: "The girl
was named Aldonza, and was very pretty and attractive, so that
there was none like her in those parts. Many gallants sought
her affection, but it was of no avail, as she was in love with a
gentle squire named Fernan, who belonged to the house of
the honoured Diego Lainez. There lived with her an old
witch, by name Mari-Perez, whom all the maidens and youths
that were in love went to consult."</p>

<p>Far be it from us to question the text which we have just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
quoted: the reader can do it if he so desires. If the occupation
of Mari-Perez may not be considered a very honourable
one, let the blame rest with the chronicler, and let it be put
down to malice, for it looks as if he harboured such against
her, to judge by the way he expresses himself. All we shall
add is that Aldonza called the old woman with whom she
lived "mother," but we are certain that she was not such, for if
she were so, that fact would have been mentioned in the
chronicle, which goes into much detail regarding the persons
who figure in it.</p>

<p>Aldonza and the woman she called her mother resided in a
cottage situated amongst the trees of a lonely glen, through
which rushed a torrent, whose roar contributed not a little to
increase the superstitious dread with which the inhabitants of
the country surrounding Vivar approached the dwelling-place
of the witch, for by that name Mari-Perez was commonly
known. Fernan, however, who did not trouble himself much
about witchcraft, knocked at the door of Aldonza, consoling
himself with the thoughts of the good reception he would
receive from Aldonza, compared with the scratches which
Mayorica had inflicted on him. The girl appeared at the small
window above the door and asked who was there.</p>

<p>"It's me," answered the squire; "open the door, for this
mist that's rising from the brook is freezing me."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Aldonza, and taking up a jug of water, she
threw it out on the unfortunate Fernan, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will die here, traitor, villain, ruffian, blackguard!
Do you think you can deceive me any longer? It is you that
are tricked now!"</p>

<p>And not content with having wetted him to the skin with
the water and nearly broken his head with the jug, she began
to hurl down on him such a quantity of tiles, stones, and other
projectiles, that if he had not sheltered himself at once behind
the trunk of an oak tree, which luckily happened to be near,
she would have nearly killed him, considering her fury and
the accuracy with which she aimed.</p>

<p>"Halt, you minx!" exclaimed Fernan, soaked through not
only with water, but also with blood. "As sure as I catch you,
I'll take every inch of skin off your back with lashes. Is it
thus, you vixen, that you treat so faithful a lover as I am?
Would that I had never set my eyes on a jade like you! May I
lose my strength if at this very moment I do not, with blows and
lashes, half kill both you and the witch who lives with you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus speaking, the squire rushed at the door and gave it a
furious kick, in order to break it in; but his own head narrowly
escaped being broken in by another jug and more tiles and
stones, which made him return to his tree more quickly than
he could have wished.</p>

<p>"What did I do to you? what did I do to you, that you
should attack me with such fury?"</p>

<p>"Be off, traitor!" replied the girl; "be off to the castle, and
tell her who awaits you there that from this day forward you
are hers alone."</p>

<p>The enamoured Fernan came now to the conclusion that
Aldonza had discovered his love for Mayorica, and he began to
think of using his eternal arithmetical argument; he remembered,
however, the little good it had done him with Mayorica,
and recognised that Aldonza was not then in a condition to
listen to reason. He thought, therefore, that the best thing
he could do would be to return to the castle, which he did,
cursing the unreasonableness of women, and swearing by all
the saints in heaven that, in future, he would have nothing to
do with any of them as long as he lived, even if a war took
place in which so many men should be killed, that there would
be a hundred women left for every man that survived.</p>

<p>Let us return with him to the Castle of Vivar and discover
who were those that we saw arriving there, and what was taking
place in it, even though the reader has most likely guessed
that they were Diego Lainez and his friends and servants, who
had set out from Leon only a short time after Rodrigo.</p>

<p>It was pitiable to see the state of affliction into which Teresa
was thrown when she saw her husband, whom she, full of love
and tenderness, ran to receive and clasp in her arms. The
honoured Diego Lainez, though he knew his wife would be
deeply pained, did not conceal from her the affront he had
received, for it was a matter of necessity for him to unbosom
himself to some beloved being, who would help him to support
such a trial. Teresa Nuña, although the most tender and
sensible of women, was endowed with great strength of
character to bear tribulations; she was one of those beings
whose presence and words strengthen the weakest, and infuse
confidence and hope into those who have almost lost them.
Thus it was that she succeeded in consoling Diego to a considerable
extent, particularly when she repeated the words
which Rodrigo used when expressing his determination that
no insult to his house should go unavenged. At that moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Diego conceived the idea of finding out for himself what he
might hope for from his son.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Rodrigo risen from his bed, when he was
informed that his father had returned to the castle; he hurried
to visit him, and entered Diego's chamber a very short time
after Teresa had quitted it.</p>

<p>"Father and lord, embrace me," he said, without noticing the
affliction which was clearly stamped on the features of the old
man. His father clasped him to his breast, and taking his
hand, pressed it between his with such force that little more
would have disjointed the fingers, for it seemed that Diego,
with the strength of his will, had concentrated in the hand
with which he squeezed that of his son all the power that the
remainder of the muscles of his body retained.</p>

<p>The youth started back, trying to disengage his hand from
the grip of his father; pain coloured his cheeks and injected
his eyes with blood.</p>

<p>"Let go, father," he cried out, "let go. Anger of God! if
you were not my father, you should pay for that squeeze you
have given me."</p>

<p>The old man let loose the hand of the youth, and pressing
him again to his breast, said, weeping, not indeed with despair
but with joy&mdash;</p>

<p>"Son of my soul! that indignation was the comfort which
your father needed. Use that fiery spirit in avenging my
honour, which is lost if your arm does not save it."</p>

<p>"Justice of God!" cried Rodrigo, rising erect like a viper
disturbed by a wayfarer. "Who is the traitor who has dared
to attack your honour&mdash;which is mine also? Tell me, father,
for neither you nor I can live, if the honour is dead, which no
person till now has ever dared to stain. Who, who is the
coward that has affronted you?"</p>

<p>"My son, the Count of Gormaz has struck me on the face
with his hand, has covered my cheek with blood in the sight
of the king and the grandees of Leon"&mdash;</p>

<p>And sobs smothered the voice of Diego.</p>

<p>"Anger of God!" exclaimed the brave youth, convulsed
with anger even greater than that which his father felt in his
grief and old age. "Do not weep, father; for I swear to you
that I shall cut off the hand which has stained your visage,
even though the cowardly felon should hide himself in the
bowels of the earth."</p>

<p>"Go, my Rodrigo, go and challenge him to single combat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
The king will oppose no obstacles to it, for God, who cannot
consent that an old man should be outraged, and an honour
thus stained which was gained by fighting for the faith during
four centuries, will put valour in your heart and strength in
your arm. Public was the offence, public also must be the
vengeance!"</p>

<p>Speaking thus, Diego Lainez went to a large press that stood
in the chamber in which they were, and contained various
kinds of arms. He took down a sword and handed it to
Rodrigo, with these words&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take and bind on, my son, the sword of Mudarra; go
and avenge with it your father."</p>

<p>Rodrigo took the sword, kissed its cross-shaped hilt, and
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Glorious sword, whose blade was tempered with the blood
of Ruiz Velasquez, be thou tempered again with that of the
cowardly Count of Gormaz, and bring honour to the arm of
the son of Diego Lainez, as the son of Gonzalo Gustios brought
honour to thee!"</p>

<p>The high price at which he valued his honour and the
magnitude of the insult he had received had caused the old
grandee to exaggerate his impotence to take vengeance on the
count; it is true that he had scarcely had an opportunity of
proving the bravery of his son; however, it was not so with
regard to many other cavaliers of his family and of his acquaintance.
Thus it happened that, on the same day that he
acquired the certainty that his son would proceed to fight for
the honour of their house, a great number of his friends and
retainers presented themselves, offering the aid of their arms,
of their riches, and of their men-at-arms, in order to wash out
the stain which he grieved over. When Rodrigo, therefore,
set out for Leon, having received the blessing of his parents,
he was followed by the good wishes of a multitude of lords
and cavaliers, and also by many of them in person, who
desired to be present at the reparation of the honour of De
Vivar, and even to defend it with the strength of their arms,
in case the youth should succumb in the combat.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW RODRIGO FOUGHT WITH THE COUNT OF GORMAZ</p></blockquote>

<p>The principal gate of the Alcazar led out on a broad
square, bounded on all sides by the magnificent mansions
of the noblest families of the city. Amongst them
was that of the Count of Gormaz, who, although he had a very
large and strong castle in the country, with appointments
worthy of a king, resided usually in the Court city, since death
had deprived him of his wife at Gormaz.</p>

<p>Don Gome had loved his wife as Diego Lainez did his, for
she had been equally worthy of being loved. Whilst he
enjoyed her affection and caresses, ambition had never come
to disturb his happiness, and he cared but little for the Court,
at which he was scarcely ever seen. However, from the time
he fixed his residence in Leon, whether it was that the death of
his dear companion had left a void in his soul, which had to
be filled up in some way, or whether it was that the glitter of a
Court life had deteriorated and darkened his heart, formerly
free from evil passions, it is certain that he became entirely
changed. Envy overmastered him, as a consequence of a
boundless ambition for honours and riches, which indeed he
had no need of, for the count was of very noble origin, and
his family one of the richest of Castile. He certainly loved
his daughter, and was loved by her; it is also certain that
Ximena had united in herself sufficient beauty, discretion, and
other good qualities to make her the pride and glory of her
father; all this, however, was not sufficient for Don Gome,
and his daughter filled but a small portion of the void left in
his heart by the death of his wife. There are in men certain
physiological phenomena which do not admit of satisfactory
explanation; in the case of the Count of Gormaz these were
very numerous.</p>

<p>Let us leave, however, this digression, and see what was
taking place in the palace of the count. In one of the apartments,
which overlooked the square of the Alcazar, was the
sweet, the beautiful, the loving Ximena, reclining on a couch,
and drying up with her handkerchief the abundant tears which
flowed from her eyes. She was thinking deeply, and her
meditations must have been tortures to her soul, to judge from
the agony which could easily be seen on her countenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Not far from her, Lambra was occupied, much less with the
work which lay upon her lap, than with drying up the tears
which the grief of her mistress caused her to shed.</p>

<p>The honoured dueña deserves that we should say a few
words about her, for the part which a dueña performed with
regard to a young girl was not an insignificant one, especially
when the maiden is in love and has lost her mother. Lambra
was one of those women whose case would almost give one a
right to speak strongly against nature, if nature were not the
work of God&mdash;of God who has a heaven, with which to compensate
people for the privations which they have to bear on
earth. She was one of those women to whom nature had
given a superabundance of love and, at the same time, had
denied them the privilege of lavishing it on men, for, as far as
she was concerned, her countenance was cast in such a mould
that the more she might desire to approach men, the more
would they fly from her. Women of this kind devote their
love to the first being that crosses their path, for if they did
not do so their hearts would burst with the affection which
fills them. In this condition was Lambra: Ximena was the
being who had crossed her path and on whom she had poured
out all the love of her heart; she was present at her birth, and
had witnessed her physical and moral development from day
to day without ever losing sight of her, thus filling up her
soul with her, if we may so express ourselves; and it may be
said indeed that the maiden formed part of her being. Thus it
was that she wept or smiled when Ximena wept or smiled,
and almost hated or loved according as Ximena did the one
or the other.</p>

<p>"Do not weep, my darling," she said to the young girl,
affecting a calmness which she did not feel; "do not think any
more of your unfortunate love affairs, for if you keep brooding
over them you will be in your grave before three days are past,
and that would be neither good nor Christian on your part.
Let God, who created us, kill us, and let us not kill ourselves."</p>

<p>"But of what use is life to me?" replied Ximena, rousing
herself from her meditations.</p>

<p>"Ave Maria! what a mad question! For what do we preserve
our lives but to be happy?"</p>

<p>"Alas, Lambra, you cannot understand that my happiness
is now impossible in this world. How can I be happy without
Rodrigo?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you then lost him?"</p>

<p>"I have lost him, Lambra. If I feared that I had lost his
love, when no really serious matter justified the hostility
between my father and his, how much stronger are now my
reasons for fearing it, when my father, the Count of Gormaz,
has imprinted on the face of his father a stain which only can
be washed off with blood? The hand of my father has opened
an abyss between both our houses."</p>

<p>Lambra knew that what Ximena said was only too true, and
felt almost dismayed by the task that was imposed on her&mdash;that
of consoling and cheering up the maiden; notwithstanding,
she did her best to conceal her inquietude, and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you feel confident that Rodrigo loves you?"</p>

<p>"I have never doubted it."</p>

<p>"And have you not often heard it said that love conquers
all things?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lambra."</p>

<p>"Then do not be disquieted, and trust that the love of
Rodrigo may be able to throw a bridge over the abyss of which
you have just spoken, in order that your house and his may
be reconciled and form again but one family."</p>

<p>This reflection, although it was rather sophistical, shed a drop
of balsam on the wound which was torturing the soul of
Ximena, into whose mind flashed, at that moment, a ray of
light: "I shall throw myself on my knees at the feet of my
father," thought to herself the daughter of Don Gome, "and I
shall beseech him to repair the offence which he has committed
against Rodrigo, and if he loves me, he will comply with my
wish."</p>

<p>Whilst Ximena was still formulating this request, her father
entered the chamber. By the appearance of his daughter,
whose face was still stained by tears, Don Gome divined her
feelings. Such were the marks that grief had imprinted, in
two days, on the visage of Ximena, that the count could not
prevent himself from being deeply moved; for he loved his
child very much, notwithstanding the fact that the evil passions
which had taken possession of his heart were causing her the
deepest misery.</p>

<p>"My daughter!" he exclaimed, pressing her tenderly in his
arms, "you weep, and do not try to find consolation and alleviation
of your troubles in me. Do you perchance doubt of the
love of your father?"</p>

<p>"Ah no, my father!" answered Ximena, bathed in tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you not know," continued the count, with endearing
accents,&mdash;"do you not know, daughter, that, from the time I
lost your mother, you have been the sole being in this world
that I have loved? Do you think that I have no care for your
happiness because I have sworn that you never shall be the
bride of the son of De Vivar?"</p>

<p>"But, father," said the young girl timidly, "you know that
such an oath destroys my happiness during my entire life."</p>

<p>"It will destroy it, if you do not forget Rodrigo."</p>

<p>"And do you believe that I can forget him? Do you
believe that a love can be forgotten that had its birth almost
at the same time that we had ours? Do you believe that it is
possible for a woman to forget a man like Rodrigo?"</p>

<p>"Nothing resists time and injuries received. Those which
Diego Lainez has inflicted on your father are such that your
union with his son would be an unbearable humiliation, not
alone to a race like that of De Gormaz, but even to that of a
low-born peasant. He who has so vilely calumniated me at the
Court; he who, for his own aggrandisement, has lowered me
so much in the eyes of the king; he who has robbed me of
the favour of Don Fernando; he who has been so treacherous
to his most loyal friend, deserved that your father should refuse
to his son your hand, and even should strike him in the face
before those in whose eyes he had so humiliated me."</p>

<p>"Consider, my father, that a fatal error may have blinded
you. If you do not wish to commit an unjust act, if you do
not desire to enter into a contest in which both of us may die,
you by a lance or sword wound, and I by the grief which your
loss would cause me, make good the insult which you offered
to Diego Lainez in the saloons of the Alcazar, and forget for
ever those which you imagine that you have received from
him"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ximena!" exclaimed the count in a severe tone, "what
advice is this you dare to give me? If it were another who so
counselled me, I would tear out his tongue. Do you value so
little the honour of your father, and do you consider him such
a coward, as to think that he should ask pardon of him in
whose face he would rather spit?"</p>

<p>The anger which the count exhibited whilst speaking those
words discouraged Ximena, and deprived her of her last hope.
The daughter of Don Gome answered her father with tears
alone. He, feeling compassion for her grief, repented of his
sudden burst of indignation, and clasped her again to his heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
pressing with his lips her pale brow. He felt, doubtless, that
his pride was yielding in presence of his child's grief, and in
order not to desist from his intention of responding with fresh
insults to the reparation which he felt would soon be demanded
from him by De Vivar, he went off from Ximena, who followed
him with her eyes to the door of the chamber as sadly as if it
were the last time she should ever see him.</p>

<p>The king, who desired to bring about the reconciliation of
the count with Diego Lainez, fearful of the fierce strife which
otherwise would blaze up between the partisans of the two
noble families, summoned Don Gome to the Alcazar. At
the moment when the count left his house in order to obey the
order of the king, there rode into the square a body of knights
who, apparently, were also proceeding to the Alcazar. Amongst
them was Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, who, as soon as he perceived
the count, separated himself from his companions, and made
his way hastily towards him.</p>

<p>"Listen, traitrous count, ignoble cavalier!" he said to him.
"I, Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, son of Diego Lainez, whom you
wounded on the face, as he is old and cannot wash away with
your blood the stain you put on his honour, do now challenge
you to single combat, in which you will fight against me; and
five knights from amongst my friends shall sustain my rights
against five chosen from your friends, in case either you
or I should fall in the battle. I am about to demand permission
for this from the king."</p>

<p>"Be off, then," answered the count, turning his shoulder on
the young man with haughty disdain; "the Count of Gormaz
fights with giants, and not with boys like you."</p>

<p>"Infamous count! boys have conquered giants," responded
Rodrigo, with much difficulty keeping down his anger.
"Remember that David was very young when he overcame
Goliath. If I am a youth in years, I am a giant in the valour
which my outraged honour and your cowardice instil into
me."</p>

<p>The count gazed on him with contempt, and proceeded a few
steps on his way. The youth, however, intercepted him, becoming
more and more enraged.</p>

<p>"Leave me," exclaimed at last Don Gome, also filled with
anger, "leave me at once; for if I wounded your father's face
with a blow of my hand, I shall chastise your insolence with
kicks."</p>

<p>Those words, and the tone in which they were spoken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
exasperated Rodrigo to the highest pitch, and he exclaimed,
placing his hand on his sword&mdash;</p>

<p>"Defend yourself, villain, defend yourself, or I shall kill
you behind your back, like a traitor and coward as you are!"</p>

<p>"You shall not do so, but you shall pay dearly for your
audacity," replied the count, unsheathing his sword, and
rushing on Rodrigo with such fury that the young man had
scarcely time to place himself on his guard.</p>

<p>The count was robust and of enormous strength, so great
that on account of it he had gained the name of <i>Lozano</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
by which he was commonly known, and which both history
and tradition have brought down to us. Rodrigo was of high
stature, but very thin, and his strength was not yet developed.
Thus it was that, the physical powers of the two combatants
not being equalised by defensive and offensive arms,&mdash;as was
usual in solemn combats, when there was great disproportion
in the strength of the two parties,&mdash;the spectators considered
the victory of the count as certain. Those present consisted
not only of the retinue which had accompanied Rodrigo, but
also of a large number of persons whom the clashing of the
swords had attracted to the windows and balconies of the
buildings which surrounded the square, or who had flowed in
through the streets that led to it. Amongst those spectators
was the king, Don Fernando himself, who appeared on a
balcony of the Alcazar just as the fate of the combatants was
about to be decided. They were fighting with a fury not
often seen; the strokes of the count were terrible from the
force with which they were dealt, but Rodrigo avoided them
with an agility and dexterity that could scarcely be expected
from him, considering the limited practice he had had in
warlike exercises, which only consisted in his having broken
a few lances at tournaments; moreover, he did not for an
instant lose the calmness and presence of mind so necessary
in a fight. At last Don Gome aimed a terrible blow at his
adversary, which the sword of Rodrigo did not altogether
succeed in warding off, and he felt the blood running down
his face. This advantage gained by his enemy, far from
discouraging him, only inflamed his anger more and more,
and lent new strength to his arm, new breath to his lungs, and
increased agility to his limbs.</p>

<p>At that moment a cry of agony was heard from the mansion
of the count, a cry which the clashings of the steels, increasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>in rapidity and force, fortunately prevented Rodrigo from
hearing. We say fortunately, for if he had heard it, his heart
would have become so troubled, that the good sword, which
he had consecrated by a reverent kiss when he received it
from his father, might have fallen from his hand. Yes; such
would likely have happened to Rodrigo, for it was Ximena
who had uttered that agonised exclamation, when, having gone
to the window of her chamber, she saw her father and her
lover fighting so fiercely; when she saw the visage of Rodrigo
bathed in blood, and perceived with the eyes of her soul that
her hopes of happiness had now indeed vanished for ever; for
her misery was certain whichever succumbed&mdash;her father or
Rodrigo. Of what use would life be to her without the
latter? And if her father fell, how could she marry his slayer?
Not in vain had she said, but a short time before, that an
almost impassable abyss had opened between her house and
that of Diego Lainez.</p>

<p>The combat, in the meantime, was raging even more fiercely
than before, and its end was evidently approaching, as the
combatants, panting and covered with blood, instead now of
defending themselves, were endeavouring, to their very utmost,
to kill each other. Don Gome then suddenly drew his dagger,
and with it in one hand, and his sword in the other, blind
with rage and desperation, rushed on Rodrigo, parrying with
his sword the strokes of his adversary, and doing his best at
the same time to pierce him with the dagger.</p>

<p>"Back, felon, traitor, back!" exclaimed Rodrigo, indignant
at the perfidy of the count. He, however, neither heard the
words nor listened to the voice of honour, which reprobates
every cavalier who has recourse to a vile stratagem in order
to conquer his enemy; Rodrigo fell back a step, and received
on the point of his sword Don Gome, who fell, pierced through,
to the ground, uttering a cry of rage and agony.</p>

<p>Loud applause resounded on all sides; cavaliers and citizens
rushed towards Rodrigo to carry him in triumph to where
his wounds could be dressed, for abundant blood was streaming
from them. Numerous flowers, which had adorned the
windows and balconies, fell at the feet of the brave youth,
and formed the victor's crown.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW XIMENA DEMANDED JUSTICE FROM THE KING
AGAINST RODRIGO DIAZ</p></blockquote>


<p>Some days have passed since Rodrigo avenged his father by
killing Don Gome, Count of Gormaz.</p>

<p>He had almost recovered from the wounds which he had
received in the combat; but there was another wound in his
soul which science could not cure. His sword had deprived
of life the father of his beloved: would she ever accept the
hand of him who had wounded her parent to the death?
Could the slayer of the Count of Gormaz hope for the love of
Ximena Gome? Nothing could console Rodrigo; no hope
of happiness remained to him. An invincible sadness overshadowed
him, which could not be driven away, either by the
joy of his parents when they saw the stain washed away which
had sullied their honour, or by the caresses and care which
they lavished on him; for Diego and Teresa had proceeded to
Leon immediately on learning the condition of their son, in
order that they might assist at the healing of his wounds.</p>

<p>One morning the king, Don Fernando, was amusing himself
in the company of his family, which he dearly loved. What
more pleasing sight than that of a powerful king, of a warrior,
as skilful as he was wise and brave, surrounded by his children
and his wife, forgetting the triumphs of his arms and the cares
of state, in order to give himself up completely to the joys of
the domestic hearth, with the same simplicity and effusion
which the humblest subject exhibits? At his side was his
wife, a noble and honoured matron, all the pleasures of whose
life were found where her husband and children were. Don
Fernando saw her, at the height of her contentment and
maternal pride, sharing with him the affection of their sons
and daughters, brave youths and beautiful maidens; his heart
participated in the satisfaction and pride of hers, and the
happy monarch considered as trifling the pleasures he enjoyed
surrounded by his courtiers, compared with those he tasted
surrounded by his family. There are in <i>The Chronicle of the
Cid</i> a few words which form the greatest eulogium on Don
Fernando as the head of a family. Those are: "He made
his sons read that they might be the better instructed; he
taught them the use of arms, how to fence and combat; also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to be hunters. And his daughters he caused to pursue their
studies under dueñas, that they might be accustomed to, and
instructed in, all that was good." If history had not distinctly
made known to us that Don Fernando I. was a tender and
affectionate father, as well as a faithful lover and husband,
the facts would be demonstrated to us by his having had no
illegitimate child, which was a very common thing amongst
the princes and lords of the period.</p>

<p>"Father," said Don Sancho, who was the eldest of the
princes, "you have spent very much time in camps, you have
often exposed your life to the swords of your enemies; live
henceforth more for your family, and do not go away from my
mother and my brothers and sisters. I, although unworthy of
so great an honour, will take your place in war; if it is
necessary to fight against the infidels and the other enemies of
Castile and Leon, do not think, my father, that fear would
cause me to vacillate or draw back, for not in vain does your
blood flow in my veins."</p>

<p>"O my son!" cried Don Fernando, feeling tears of joy
coming to his eyes, and clasping Don Sancho in his arms, "I
do not now fear death, for Leon and Castile will have in you
the best of kings! Secure of leaving behind me such a
successor, I shall care not should I lose my life in the wars."</p>

<p>"Not care for your life?" exclaimed at the same time the
queen and his children.</p>

<p>"How would it be with us should you die, dear father?"
said Urraca, the eldest of the princesses. "Grief would kill us
also! Sad is the lot of daughters who love their father very
much and lose him!"</p>

<p>Just then it was announced to the king that Ximena Gome
requested an audience. Don Fernando, who never refused to
hear his subjects, now felt, more than ever, the desire of
consoling the afflicted, and believing that the daughter of the
late Count of Gormaz was very unhappy, he ordered that she
should be conducted before him.</p>

<p>"Justice, my lord, justice!" exclaimed Ximena, casting
herself at the feet of the king, and unable to articulate other
words, for sobs were almost choking her.</p>

<p>The noble maiden was completely changed, a fearful pallor
covered her emaciated face, which was wet with tears, and
even the disorder of her garments and hair showed her
grief.</p>

<p>"Justice, my lord, justice!" she repeated, as if she were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
about to lose her reason, and as if the idea which those
words conveyed was the last glimmering light of her mind.</p>

<p>The king, the queen, and the princesses endeavoured to
calm the excitement of her mind with affectionate words, and
their efforts were not unavailing, for in a short time she was
able to express the feelings which overmastered her, and the
desire which had led her thither.</p>

<p>"My lord, an audacious youth, the son of Diego Lainez,
slew my father, the Count of Gormaz, a few days ago, as you
already know. Grief has kept me prostrate on my bed until
to-day, when I come to demand justice from you. Grant it to
me, my lord, by punishing the slayer of my father, for if good
kings represent on earth the authority of God, you, my lord,
must punish a murderer, under pain of incurring the displeasure
both of God and of men. During the fever which
has been burning in my brain since the day on which the
hand of Rodrigo made me an orphan, I have seen the spirit
of my father, rising from his sepulchre and demanding
vengeance, and I promised it to him, counting on your
justice. If you do not grant it to me, my lord, cavaliers are
not wanting amongst my kinsmen who will respond to my
request; I shall go through your states of Leon and Castile,
demanding the aid of all good men, and both friends and
strangers will hearken to my call, and the horrors of war will
avenge your injustice and the perfidy of De Vivar."</p>

<p>"Calm your grief and your resentment, Ximena," answered
the king in a kind voice, "for I promise to do you justice. If
Rodrigo Diaz treacherously killed your father, justice shall
bring down her inexorable sword on his head, just as if he
were the humblest of my subjects."</p>

<p>"My lord, I trust in your promise. Ask the princesses,
what they think is the grief of a daughter who loses her
father, and the anger she should feel against the man who
killed him. Those who love you as I loved my father can
well understand what I suffer, and will make you also, my
lord, understand it."</p>

<p>"I have been informed that Rodrigo killed your father in
fair and honourable combat, and for my own part I can
assure you that your father had his sword, and also his dagger,
unsheathed. That he was not attacked unarmed is proved
by the dangerous wounds which he inflicted on Rodrigo."</p>

<p>"Ah! dangerous wounds!" exclaimed Ximena, her face
again becoming pale, which had coloured up with excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
whilst she was addressing the king; and then she felt her
impotence in trying to conquer love with feelings of revenge.
What would she not have given, at that moment, to be able
to tear from her heart that undying affection which, in her
mind, was a crime against the dead body of her father, whose
wounds were still dropping blood and crying for vengeance!</p>

<p>That exclamation was also a revelation to the king, who,
not being ignorant of the love which had formerly united
Rodrigo and Ximena, doubted whether it could have been
completely extinguished in her, and changed to hatred, as the
demand she made of him seemed to testify. Don Fernando,
however, knew human hearts, especially the hearts of women,
too well, to openly oppose her feelings, especially when he felt
almost sure that they were but transitory; he knew very well
that when a sentiment is rooted in the core of the heart, it
goes on increasing, of itself, until it is powerful enough to
drive away all others which had been pressing it down, in
the same way that the sun drives off the clouds that for a time
obscure his brightness, showing himself soon again with the
glory of the conqueror. The wise monarch also knew that
the weakest and most superficial caprices change, when
strongly opposed, into strong and deep determinations, and
for that reason he resolved to temporise with Ximena,
trusting that time would make her desist from her complaints.
He knew the Count of Gormaz and Rodrigo well enough to
feel certain on whose side was the right, and he had not
forgotten the grave offence by which the former had given the
latter just excuse to kill him, even if the fight had been with
equal arms, much more so when perfidy was resorted to, for
Don Gome had acted in a perfidious manner, striking on the
face an honourable and feeble old man who had held out his
hand generously to him.</p>

<p>"Ximena," he said to the maiden, "I repeat that you shall
receive justice from me; if Rodrigo acted treacherously he
shall be punished, and you know that in my realm there is
justice for all, and no one can escape it, be he ever so
powerful."</p>

<p>Ximena returned to her dwelling. Notwithstanding the
promise that the king had given her to punish Rodrigo if he
were guilty, her inquietude, her grief, and her despair had
increased rather than diminished. That night her sleep was
a delirium in which was epitomised an eternity of torments;
a horrible nightmare pressed on her for long hours; she saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
a man, exhaling his last breath, and calling out her name,
the name of Ximena.</p>

<p>And that man was not he whom she had seen during the
nightmares of preceding nights, that man was not her father.</p>

<p>He was Rodrigo Diaz!</p>

<p>When she awoke, when she succeeded in shaking off that
terrible nightmare, at the very instant in which she was
struggling to get near the dying man, in order to infuse new
life into him with her breath, calling him by the sweet names
which she had lavished on him in other times, when they
wandered through the fields of Gormaz, or those of Vivar,
happy and joyful as the birds and butterflies, then,&mdash;ah! then,
she became enraged with herself, tore her hair in terrible
despair, and rushed to the window of her chamber in order
to throw herself from it; and she would have done so, if
Lambra, who watched constantly by her side, disconsolate
and despairing like herself, had not pulled her back, despite
her struggles, which were but feeble, as her strength had been
much reduced by grief and by fever.</p>

<p>And when she recognised her impotence, not alone to crush
down her love, but also to find death as an end to her
sufferings, she fell on her knees, and, raising her eyes and
hands to heaven, she exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"O my father, pardon, pardon! Mother, why did you
not smother me in your arms when you brought me into
the world?"</p>

<p>She then fell on the floor, like an inert mass, and the voice
of Lambra resounded through the mansion, summoning
assistance for her mistress.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following morning Ximena rose from her bed very
early, notwithstanding her strength being so reduced that she
could scarcely walk a step without stumbling, and began to
make preparations for a journey.</p>

<p>"But, my lady," said Lambra, "would you not be better
at Gormaz, where all love you, and where you would have
your own house and the recollections of your childhood?"</p>

<p>"It is from those very recollections that I desire to fly,
for you well know that Rodrigo and I passed our childhood
partly at Gormaz and partly at Vivar."</p>

<p>"You are right; I did not think of that; but, however it
may be, it would be a sad life in a desert like"&mdash;</p>

<p>"My life must be a sad one wherever I may be; and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
my only hope is now of heaven, I desire to make myself
deserving of it whilst I live on earth. If the king will not
do me justice, the friends of my father will do so; but I
have not courage to hunt down him who shed my father's
blood.... I will not persecute him, but I shall forget him
for ever."</p>

<p>Ximena and Lambra continued to get together all the
articles necessary for a long journey.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to bring these trifles with you?" asked the
dueña, showing to her mistress a casket which, with other
things, she had taken from a drawer.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Ximena; "for that casket contains many
souvenirs of my mother.... But oh!" she added, "it also
contains some of Rodrigo. Give it to me, give it to me. I
will keep for ever those of my mother, but I shall burn
those of that traitor."</p>

<p>And taking the case in her hand, she began to turn over the
things which it contained. They were, for the most part,
ribbons, flowers, rings, and children's toys. The first she drew
out was a wreath of flowers. "Ah!" she said, "with this
wreath he adorned my brow on my fifteenth birthday!"</p>

<p>She was about to pull it to pieces with her hands, but she
feared to touch the flowers, as if they were covered with
thorns. She then drew forth a black curl bound with green
ribbon, and said, "Here is a lock of his hair which he gave
me the last time we were together at Gormaz, as a pledge of a
love which he himself has destroyed!" And she raised
her hand to cast it far from her; but she stopped, pensive,
and apparently struggling with opposing feelings. Suddenly
tears gushed from her eyes, and she cried out, placing the
wreath and the curl again in the casket, "Leave them there,
Lambra, leave them there; and let this wreath and this curl
be the haircloth to torture me in my solitude."</p>

<p>The maiden remained motionless for a short time, during
which she ran over in her imagination the story of her love&mdash;the
story of her life&mdash;for they were both but one. The purest
love,&mdash;ardent, surrounded with heavenly illusions, with gilded
dreams, with light, with flowers,&mdash;the beauty of which can
only be understood by certain enamoured souls,&mdash;had entirely
made up the life of Ximena. And at seeing her hopes blasted,
at seeing parched up, never to sprout forth again, that flower
of paradise which perfumed and inebriated her soul, she felt
her heart torn with the profoundest sadness, with an immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
despair, with an agony that cannot be described. The youth
or the maiden who has consecrated entire years to a love
which holds its mastery in dreams as well as in waking hours,
always sweet, always beautiful, always surrounded by an
enchantment superior to all other enchantments of this world,
and in a day, in a few hours, loses, without hope of recovering
it, the object of that love&mdash;such a youth or maiden only can
comprehend the grief of Ximena. In those moments of
terrible despair the sole comfort that can be found is to have
a mother, a father, a brother, a friend&mdash;some being sufficiently
good and sensible not to laugh at our tears, so that we may
cast ourselves into his arms and weep on his breast, saying,
"My heart is pierced; give me, for the sake of God, a little
love, with which I may calm my grief; fill up, as much as is
in your power, that deep void which is left in my soul; make
less bitter the transition state from hope to despair!"</p>

<p>And it was granted to Ximena to enjoy that comfort: she
had Lambra beside her, plain and homely, perhaps, but
affectionate and good, and she threw herself into her arms
and solaced herself with copious tears.</p>

<p>On that same day the disconsolate girl set out for Castile,
accompanied by the dueña and a few of her servants; and
tradition affirms that, after them, a youth went out from Leon,
who stopped on an eminence near the city, and followed with
his gaze the daughter of Don Gome, until a distant turn of
the road removed her from his view.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW A MOORISH PRINCESS WAS CONVERTED, AND HOW
A SOLITARY CEASED TO BE SUCH</p></blockquote>


<p>At that time the Moor Almenon was King of Toledo,
and with him Don Fernando the Great, King of Castile
and Leon, kept up a cordial friendship. This Moorish
monarch had a daughter, very beautiful and tender-hearted,
named Casilda.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of the gardens which surrounded the Alcazar
of Almenon, there were gloomy dungeons in which wept, half-starved
and loaded with chains, many Christian captives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, when Casilda was walking in her father's gardens,
she heard the sad wailings of those captives: her kind heart
caused her to weep for their sufferings, for she liked Christians
from the time when, in her girlhood, a Castilian female slave
told her that the Christians loved God, their king, and their
families; that amongst them the weak and oppressed were
protected; that they rewarded the good and punished evil-doers.</p>

<p>The princess then returned to the palace, with her heart full
of sadness, and knelt at the feet of her father, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"My father, in the dungeons near your gardens a large
number of captives are suffering. Remove their chains from
them, open the doors of their prisons, and let them return to
their own country, where await them, sad and weeping, their
parents, their brethren, their wives, or their lovers."</p>

<p>Almenon blessed his daughter in the depths of his heart, for
it was naturally good, and as Casilda was kind and beautiful,
and his only daughter, he loved her as the apple of his eye.
What loving father does not rejoice when he sees that his
children are good and tender-hearted?</p>

<p>The King of Toledo, however, far from complying with
Casilda's request, considered that he was bound to punish her
rashness, for to compassionate Christian captives and plead for
their liberty was a crime, according to the traditional belief of
those of his race and religion.</p>

<p>For this reason he concealed the contentment of his soul;
for this reason he said to Casilda, with a stern look and
threatening voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Depart, unbeliever! be silent, unworthy princess! Your
tongue shall be cut out, and your body cast into the flames,
for such is the punishment merited by the Moslim who pleads
for the Nazarenes."</p>

<p>And he was about to summon his executioners, in order to
hand his daughter over to them.</p>

<p>Casilda, however, fell again at his feet, asking pardon from
him by the memory of her mother, the late queen, whose
death Almenon had now wept for a year.</p>

<p>And Almenon felt his eyes wet with tears, and he pressed
her against his breast and pardoned her, kissing her at the
same time; he said, however&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take care, my daughter, not to plead again for the
Christians, nor even to feel pity for them, for then I shall
have neither pardon nor compassion for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The maiden, nevertheless, walked again in the gardens,
and the wailings of the captives came again to her ears;
charity strengthened her heart and illumined her soul.</p>

<p>The princess bribed with gold one of the guards of the
dungeons, and from that time she went every day, bringing
food and consolation to the poor captives.</p>

<p>One day she was carrying food concealed in the folds of her
garments, when she suddenly met her father on a winding
path, bordered by rose-bushes.</p>

<p>It was a morning in springtime; the roses were expanding
their blooms all around; the birds were singing in the
branches of the trees; the sun was just beginning to cast his
rays on the limpid jets of the fountains; and the air was
sweetened with the most delicious odours.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here so early?" asked Almenon of
the maiden.</p>

<p>"My father," answered the princess, becoming as red as the
roses which the morning breeze was agitating by her side, "I
have come to gaze upon and enjoy the odour of those flowers, to
hear the carols of the birds, and to see the sun's rays sparkling
in the fountains."</p>

<p>"What are you carrying in the folds of your dress?" asked
the king in a stern voice.</p>

<p>"Roses which I have gathered from these bushes," replied
Casilda, imploring from the bottom of her heart the aid of a
holy being named Mary, of whom, when she was a child, she
had heard the Christian slave speaking.</p>

<p>And Almenon, doubting her answer, opened the folds of
her dress, and a shower of roses fell upon the ground.</p>

<p>From that day the princess redoubled her assistance and
her consolations towards the captives; from that day she was
more loved by her father; from that day she adored, on the
altar of her heart, the Nazarene Divinity, and felt an ardent
desire to adore Him in the Christian temples. God, who
sometimes leads His creatures to their good by the strangest
paths, struck down the bodily health of Casilda by a disease,
which withered the roses on her cheeks and filled Almenon
and his Court with uneasiness and fear.</p>

<p>The most famous physicians of Seville and Cordova were
summoned to Toledo; but they exhausted their science, and
could not restore the princess to health.</p>

<p>Almenon then wrote to the King of Leon and Castile, asking
him to send the best physician at his Court, and Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Fernando hastened to comply with his request, for he also
had daughters whom he loved, as Almenon loved his.</p>

<p>The Leonese doctor came to the conclusion that the only
chance of saving the princess was by sending her to Castile,
in which there was a lake, the waters of which had great
curative virtues, especially regarding the disease from which
Casilda was suffering.</p>

<p>And she went to Castile, entrusted by her father to the care
of Don Fernando, and having bathed in the lake of San
Vicente, which is in the province of Briviesca, she recovered
her health, and the roses again bloomed on her cheeks.</p>

<p>However, when the waters of the lake of San Vicente had
healed her body, Casilda desired that the waters of the Jordan
should heal her soul, and she received baptism, her godfather
and godmother being the King and Queen of Castile and
Leon.</p>

<p>Her father learned soon that she had embraced the faith of
the Nazarene, and sent her word that he wished to see her no
more. Casilda wept, for she knew that her father also wept;
but Jesus, who had restored to health the daughter of Jairus,
who had suffered as she had done, said, "There is no man,
that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother,
or wife, or children, or lands, for My sake, and the gospel's,
but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,
and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
lands, with persecutions: and in the world to come eternal
life." And Casilda desired to follow the Nazarene.</p>

<p>She then determined to consecrate her life to penitence,
where the tumult of worldly passions could not interrupt her
in her holy task, and where, at the same time, she could
practise charity towards all who might be in need of it.</p>

<p>The lake of San Vicente was situated in a lonely, rugged
country, and thus the poor invalids who went to seek health in
its waters could find no person to extend hospitality to them,
and very many died from the cold of the winter, or the heat
of the summer, both of which were excessive in that region.</p>

<p>Casilda erected there a hermitage, and resolved to pass her
life in it, dedicating herself to the service of God, and to the
care of suffering and despairing human beings.</p>

<p>One day she saw a number of persons, some riding and
some on foot, who were making their way towards her humble
abode, situated on the margin of the lake. A litter, drawn by
a horse, came on in the rear, in which she thought she per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>ceived
two women. She believed that some invalids were
coming in search of health, as frequently happened, on account
of the beneficial qualities of the waters of the lake, and she
hastened to meet them, in order to offer them her charitable
care and the hospitality of her dwelling. Indeed, one at least
of the two women who occupied the litter appeared to be in
a very weakly state, to judge from the pallor and emaciation of
her face. Casilda had arrived within a short distance of the
litter, and seeing that its drivers were in doubt as to the way
they should go, for the ground was very rough and covered
with brambles, amongst which it was difficult to discern the
paths that led towards the lake and the hermitage of the
solitary, she said to the strangers&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you are coming to my dwelling-place, where I shall
willingly receive you, I shall guide you to it by the shortest
and easiest path."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the pale woman in the litter, "we were proceeding
to your dwelling, and may God recompense you for
any kindness and hospitality you show us."</p>

<p>Casilda then walked on towards her hermitage, and the litter
followed.</p>

<p>When all had arrived at the door, the women descended
from the vehicle, and Casilda recognised the younger of the
women, who also knew her. They embraced each other
warmly.</p>

<p>"Ximena!" exclaimed the daughter of Almenon, "you in
those solitudes! Why, notwithstanding the emaciation of
your face, did I not at once recognise you&mdash;you to whom I
was offering hospitality, as if to a stranger, rather than to one
whom I hold deep in my heart?"</p>

<p>"You see me here, Casilda," said Ximena,&mdash;"you see me
here, seeking, not the health of my body in the waters of this
lake, but that of my soul in solitude, in mortification, in
prayer, and in charitable works; I therefore desire to be your
companion in this holy and peaceful retreat."</p>

<p>"You are indeed welcome, friend of my soul! who thus
abandons the pleasures of the Court, in order to serve God
and humanity in this desert. Come into my dwelling, which
is yours also, and take some repose, for you have indeed need
of it, as has also this worthy lady, after the fatigues of your
journey."</p>

<p>In truth, Ximena and Lambra, for now we know that they
were the travellers, were almost dead with weariness, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
had been obliged to go a considerable portion of the way on
foot, as some of the paths were so rugged and bad that it
would have been dangerous to remain in the litter.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, Ximena sent away the vassals and
servants who had accompanied her, and entered the hermitage
with Casilda, opening her heart to her, as she would have
opened it to her mother, if God had left her by her side to
strengthen her soul in the violent storm through which it was
passing.</p>

<p>We have seen that these two noble maidens knew each
other formerly. Ximena indeed had several opportunities of
meeting Casilda during the time she had spent at the Court of
Don Fernando, previous to her baptism, and two good and
generous souls need but a short time to understand each
other. They understood and loved each other in a few days.</p>

<p>Let us now leave them together in that solitude, which
worldly cares did not disturb, for other sad souls, like that of
Ximena, call upon us to reveal their griefs to the world.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW MARTIN SET OUT TO AVENGE HIS FATHER</p></blockquote>


<p>Not far from the river Cea lived an old peasant named
Ivan, who had been a crossbow-man, in the time of the last
Count of Castile, afterwards lance-page, and finally squire.
Tired of the dangerous and agitated life which those of his
profession had to go through, and being the possessor of a
little money, which, by economy, he had saved during several
years, he bought a cottage, with a few acres of land, retired to
it with his wife and children, and had lived there for some time,
quite ignorant of what was passing in the world, for his dwelling-place
was in a lonely valley, the quietude of which was only
disturbed once a year by pilgrims who passed through it on
their way to the shrine which was near it.</p>

<p>On the night succeeding the day on which the annual
festival was held there, Ivan was sleeping tranquilly, for he
had taken part in the pilgrimage, when, at the first crow of the
cock, someone knocked and called out loudly at the door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
The farmer awoke, went to his window, and asked, by no
means in a good temper&mdash;</p>

<p>"What drunken fellow is thumping at my door? By St.
James! this is a nice hour to disturb from their sleep people
who have to get up early to go to their field-work."</p>

<p>"Anger of God! what a churl you are, Señor Ivan!" answered
the unknown person, who did not appear to be in better
humour than the farmer. "Open the door at once, and cease
your chattering, for there is no drunkard here, or anything like
one. Don't you know me?"</p>

<p>"May God forsake me if it is not that fool Martin!"</p>

<p>"The very same, confound you! Open at once, if you
don't want me to break in the door."</p>

<p>The farmer hastened to light a candle, and to let the stranger
in. On seeing him he started back, horror-struck: everything
showed that the newly arrived had been engaged, a very short
time before, in a fierce fight; his hands, his face, and even his
clothes were covered with blood.</p>

<p>"Glorious St. Isadore!" exclaimed Ivan, "what is the matter?
You are wounded?"</p>

<p>"In the soul!" replied the young man. "The wounds on
my body matter little, for they are only scratches that can
easily be healed."</p>

<p>"Let me examine them for you."</p>

<p>"It is useless, Señor Ivan. Those which it is important for
me to heal are the wounds of my soul; the medicine you have
to supply me with is a lance, a crossbow, a sword, some arm
or other, for I come to ask nothing else of you."</p>

<p>"I shall give you one with pleasure, for there are plenty of
arms in my house, thanks to my old profession, and also to the
need I have of them in this lonely place, where I have often
to defend myself against bandits."</p>

<p>Ivan approached the light to one of the walls, on which
were hung various arms, and added&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take whichever you please, for the bravest knight of Leon
or Castile does not possess better tempered ones."</p>

<p>The young man took down a lance and also a sword, which
he girt on with as much skill as the most experienced cavalier
could have used, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks, Señor Ivan. God be with you and do not tell
anyone that you have seen me to-night."</p>

<p>"But, Martin, won't you tell me what you are going to do?
What has happened to you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some day you shall know, Señor Ivan."</p>

<p>"But where are you going, my son?"</p>

<p>"To avenge my father, who lies dead in the wood; and
Beatrice, who has already perhaps been dishonoured by Don
Suero&mdash;may God curse him, and may this lance soon pierce
him through!"</p>

<p>"May it be so!" replied the farmer, embracing the young
man, who, throwing the lance across his shoulder, went forth
from the house and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>Martin walked a long distance through the dark woods,
until he came to another house, situated in the midst of large
and fertile meadows.</p>

<p>This house, or rather stable, belonged to Don Suero, and in
it was kept a magnificent stud of horses, the property of the
count, which also had the use of the meadows, and of which
a single groom had the care.</p>

<p>Martin struck a heavy blow on the door of the stable.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" called out the groom.</p>

<p>"Open, if you do not wish me to break in the door, and
your head as well."</p>

<p>The groom considered himself too weak to resist a man who
spoke in such a way. He opened the door, trembling, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon, sir cavalier."</p>

<p>"I am not a cavalier," interrupted Martin; "but I want to
be one. Get out the best horse you have in the stables."</p>

<p>"I would be delighted to please your honour, but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Fore God! he addresses me with 'buts'!" exclaimed
Martin, placing his hand on his sword.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir cavalier," the groom said, terrified, going
into the stalls and unloosing one of the best horses; "I only
wished to tell you that my master will almost beat me to death
when he finds that I have let one of his best horses be sto&mdash;I
mean taken away. Does this one please your lordship?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Martin; "put that saddle on it, which I see
hanging up there."</p>

<p>"Sir knight, that saddle is the one which is used in trying
the paces of the horses when my master comes to select one,
and if you take it what will become of me?"</p>

<p>"Be quick, I tell you; it will be only a few blows more or
less," said Martin in a threatening tone.</p>

<p>The groom saddled the horse without further reply. Martin
buckled on a pair of spurs, which he demanded from him, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
persuaded that the man had not recognised him, he thought it
most prudent to say no more. He then sprang upon the
horse, and giving the excellent steed a sharp stroke, he disappeared
through the adjacent fields.</p>

<p>Not far from the road which led from Burgos to Leon there
was a hill, situated so near it that its course could be seen
from it for a long distance; this hill was the resort of a band
of robbers who at that time were the terror of travellers who
journeyed through that district. Martin rode on to it, and
arrived there shortly after daybreak. He advanced a little into
a wood which grew on the hill, and cried out, making a kind
of speaking-trumpet of his hand&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hallo, bandits!"</p>

<p>The look-out, whom the robbers had stationed not far from
the place where Martin stopped, had perceived him a short
time before he spoke, and as he saw that he came alone he did
not think it necessary to give the signal of alarm to his
companions.</p>

<p>"Where is the cavalier going?" he cried out in his turn.</p>

<p>"To ask that I may be admitted into your honourable band."</p>

<p>Martin knew that honour is such a fine thing that even
bandits like it to be attributed to them.</p>

<p>"If such is your intention," said the look-out, "follow the
path you see then, and at the end of it you will find the entire
band, whose chief will, perchance, concede to you the honour
which you solicit."</p>

<p>The young man then advanced, and in a short time
discovered the bandits, who were about twenty in number,
and who were lying under trees, to the trunks of which their
horses were fastened. Martin could scarcely forbear from
shuddering and feeling a sense of repugnance, when he saw
the ferocity which was stamped on their visages, and when he
heard the filthy language they were using. On perceiving him,
one of them arose, who was distinguished from the others by
his garb and by the large scars which were on his hands and
face. Martin began to make known to him the object which
led him thither, but the captain of the bandits, for it was no
other, interrupted him, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brother, do you think we are deaf? We have heard you
and we now know for what you come. Tell me, however,
what is it that entitles you to be admitted into the band of the
Raposo,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for by that name the son of my mother is known?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anger of God, Don Raposo, if it were any other but you
who asked me that question, you should soon pay a visit to
your friend Señor Lucifer. Do you not see, confound you,
the blood which I have on my hands and garments, and the
wounds on my face. This blood does not come from
slaughtering cattle, nor those scratches from a jealous sweetheart.
Go to the place I shall mention to you, and you will
find the body of the cavalier whose life I have taken, in order
to provide myself with these arms and this steed, and when
you are coming back fetch me the dagger which I forgot to
draw from his breast."</p>

<p>"You don't waste much respect on him who is to be your
captain," said the Raposo; "but I desire to be indulgent
towards you as a reward for the good work you have done. I
believe what you say, for you could not have become
possessed in any other way of these arms and that splendid
horse, for your dress and your manner shows me that you are
just as much a cavalier as I am a bishop. However, if you
wish to become a member of our honourable brotherhood,
you must take the usual oath."</p>

<p>"I will take a hundred of them if you like," answered
Martin, dismounting.</p>

<p>The captain of the bandits walked over to a tree, at the foot
of which were heaped up a great number of sacred vessels and
ornaments, which they had stolen that night from a neighbouring
church, and taking up a crucifix of considerable value he
held it up before the youth, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you swear fidelity to your brethren? Will you swear
to carry off women, to enter and plunder houses and churches,
palaces and huts? Will you swear to rob and kill priests the
same as laymen, poor the same as rich, women the same as
men, children the same as grown-up people?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I swear!" replied Martin, firmly resolved, however,
not to keep so sacrilegious an oath, for he did not consider
himself bound to do so, taking it only with his lips and not
from his soul.</p>

<p>"Salute our new brother!" said the Raposo, turning
towards his companions. They went up to him and embraced
him one after the other.</p>

<p>"Brother," continued the captain, "when this ceremony was
ended, you now must know that he who is honoured by being
received into our band, is obliged to celebrate his admission
by giving a skin of good wine to all the members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
confraternity. I suppose that the late owner of your arms and
steed had also a well-lined purse, full of gold coins, and
therefore, I expect that you will be generous towards us."</p>

<p>Martin was rather perplexed at this requirement, for he had
no money whatever; knowing, however, that with such people
he must show himself a braggart in every way, he replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"If another had expressed a doubt of my generosity, he
would lose his tongue for it. I have not a single miserable
coin about me; what do I want with money? By all the
saints in heaven and all the demons in hell, do you imagine
that I am one of those honest peasants who only drink when
they can pay for it?"</p>

<p>All the bandits pulled out purses full of gold, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brother, take as much money as you want; we will lend it
to you until we make our next haul; you can then pay us back
out of your share of it."</p>

<p>"I thank you," replied Martin; "but I won't take it, for I
don't want it. You will see, by Señor Noah, that I'll manage
to get wine enough to make half Castile drunk, even if, to
procure it, I have to send to the devil all the innkeepers within
ten leagues round us."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he gave spurs to his horse, rode through the
thick wood, and disappeared, light as the wind, in the
direction of a lonely hostelry, which could scarcely be
distinguished on the distant horizon. He paid no attention
to the voices of his new comrades, who called after him,
cautioning him of the risk he ran of falling into the hands of a
patrol of the Salvadores,<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> bodies of armed horsemen who, by
command of the king, requested to give it by the Count of
Carrion and other grandees, wandered through that district for
the purpose of protecting travellers from the attacks of the
highwaymen.</p>

<p>We know not how Martin arranged matters with the
innkeeper, but two hours had scarcely passed when he returned,
bringing, thrown across his saddle-bow, a large leather wine-bag,
which contained fully twenty gallons, according to our
modern measures. Shouts of joy and loud applause received
him on his return.</p>

<p>"He is a good comrade, and will be the pride of the band
of the Raposo."</p>

<p>"What an aroma that wine has! It is three years old, at
least."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'd like to have some of those Moorish dogs here, to see
if they would turn up their noses at that gift of God."</p>

<p>"The monks of Sahagun never taste better."</p>

<p>"Thunder and lightning, what a night we'll have with it!"</p>

<p>"I'd turn Moor at once if Mahomet were only as good as
it is."</p>

<p>"The innkeeper was a heretic, and kept it without
baptizing it."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, the wine-bag is a Moor&mdash;it is a Moor!"</p>

<p>"Then let us attack him. To arms&mdash;to arms! War, war!"</p>

<p>"War to the Moor! Up for St. James and Spain!"</p>

<p>Such were some of the exclamations which followed the
arrival of Martin.</p>

<p>Having uttered these cries, the bandits took several sacred
vessels from the heap whence the Raposo took the crucifix
on which he had administered the oath to Martin, and the
sacrilegious ruffians filled them with wine and lifted them to
their impure lips.</p>

<p>Martin shuddered at the sight of this impious profanation
and did not take any part in it.</p>

<p>The Raposo noticed this, and said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brother, you would make a bad priest if you can't drink
out of a chalice. Is it because you have not taken orders?"</p>

<p>"By Lucifer!" exclaimed Martin, placing his hand on his
sword, feeling persuaded that he was lost if he did not put on
a bold face. "Know, Don Raposo, or Don Villain, that if
I have not orders I at least have a sword, and that if I do
not drink wine, I'll drink the blood of anyone that insults me
as you do."</p>

<p>"So, low peasant," replied the Raposo, also placing his hand
on his steel, "you dare to speak thus to your captain! I'll
resign my honourable position if my dagger does not teach you
to be respectful."</p>

<p>The two opponents held their naked swords, and were about
to rush on each other; all the bandits, however, hastened to
make peace, trying to persuade the Raposo that their new
comrade, instead of meriting punishment, deserved praise, since
by his audacity he showed what might be expected from him
when occasion should arise. These reasonings appeared to be
satisfactory to the Raposo; he laid aside his vexation and
stretched out his hand to Martin, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon, brother; I only wished to try your mettle, and I
am satisfied with it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"You, señor captain, must pardon me," replied the young
man, clasping the rough hand of the bandit; "but know that I
cannot bear being calumniated, by being supposed incapable
of doing what my comrades do. Do you think that it is
scruples of conscience that prevent me from using these
vessels? I want a big draught of wine to satisfy my thirst,
and I shall not drink it from a nutshell, as you do."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Martin took the helmet from the head of one
of the robbers, poured wine into it and emptied it at a draught,
amid the applause and acclamations of the bandits.</p>

<p>They continued without ceasing their libations, the wine-bag
was getting emptier and emptier, and drunkenness was
overmastering all of them, including the captain. Notwithstanding,
Martin kept his head clear, whether it was that he
was more accustomed to wine, or, which is more probable, that
he drank very little, although he lifted the helmet often to his
mouth, taking advantage of the condition of his companions.</p>

<p>The state in which they then were was horrible to see; their
lips only uttered blasphemies, obscene expressions, and disconnected
phrases; and in the end sleep took possession of
the greater part of them. Even the look-out had abandoned
his post, seeing that his comrades did not come to relieve him,
and as he was desirous of participating in their libations and
uproarious merriment.</p>

<p>It appeared to Martin that he heard the sound of the footsteps
of horses in the direction of the main road, and, turning
in that direction, he cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Salvadores! Up, comrades! the Salvadores!"</p>

<p>Five or six of the bandits arose on hearing that cry, and,
following the example of Martin, hastened to mount their
horses. Some of the others, including the Raposo, were fast
asleep, and the rest, having tried to rise, fell back again on the
ground.</p>

<p>The danger was imminent, the situation was desperate; the
hill extended in its entire length only about fifteen hundred
paces, and was surrounded on all sides by an extensive and
bare plain. The only exit from the wood was the path which
led to the road, for the roughness of the ground and the closeness
of the trees and bushes made it impossible for horses to
proceed in any other direction. If Martin and his companions
abandoned their steeds, and hid themselves in the brushwood,
they would be very soon discovered; if they tried to go on foot
across the plain, they could easily be overtaken by the Sal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>vadores,
who were mounted on swift horses. What course
should then be adopted? This question was asked him by
the robbers, when the band of the Salvadores, only about
forty paces distant from them, was advancing in their direction
as quickly as the nature of the ground permitted.</p>

<p>"Companions," said Martin, placing himself at their head,
"no other resource remains for us but to break through them,
sword in hand, and endeavour to reach the plain, whether we
are killed or not."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, forward!" they all cried out, knowing that Martin
had indicated the only means of escape left for them, and they
put spurs to their horses. As that of Martin was the best, the
least fatigued, and the lightest, the young man preceded his
comrades by a short distance, and rushing, with sword in hand,
into the midst of the Salvadores, he unhorsed one of them
with almost each stroke, and the others followed him, and broke
through their opponents, not less boldly and promptly. At
last they succeeded in gaining the main road, from whence they
heard the death-cries of those whom they had left in the wood,
struck down by the swords of the Salvadores; they then fled
across the plain in the direction of the mountains of Oca.</p>

<p>Martin had received several wounds, although none of them
were serious, and was losing much blood. After some time
they arrived at a small hill, surrounded by trees on all sides,
and from which the surrounding country could be seen for a
considerable distance.</p>

<p>"Brother, let us dismount here, that we may examine your
wounds," said his companions to Martin.</p>

<p>They at once dismounted, and all the bandits embraced
Martin, calling him their deliverer.</p>

<p>"You shall be our captain," said one of them, "for you are
worth more than a hundred like Raposo."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you shall be our captain, brother. Long live our
captain!" they all cried out unanimously and with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I thank you, comrades," replied Martin; "and I swear by
those dogs of Salvadores whom my good sword has sent to the
other world, that I shall prove myself worthy of the honour
you confer on me. You have heard the cries of agony of our
companions, who have been cowardly butchered by those
fellows?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we have heard them! Poor Captain Raposo!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, it is for us to avenge them. You do not yet
know the name of your new captain. I call myself the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Vengador,<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> brothers. Let the band, then, of the Vengador be
as much feared as was that of the Raposo; war to the death
against the grandees who urged on the king to institute the
brotherhood of the Salvadores. At present we are weak, but in
a short time we shall be strong; we are persecuted to-day, to-morrow
we shall be protected everywhere, if you will only obey
my orders and be guided by my advice."</p>

<p>"We shall be your slaves, brother captain. You are skilful
and brave, we owe you our safety, and we trust in you to
avenge our comrades."</p>

<p>"Now listen, brothers," continued Martin; "I wish to explain
to you what our conduct is to be from this day."</p>

<p>"But, captain," interrupted one of the band, "let us first
bandage your wounds, for you will lose much blood if we don't
do so."</p>

<p>"No, by Beelzebub! My blood must run till the venom,
which the cowardly conduct of those vile Salvadores has put
into it, has all left it."</p>

<p>This answer of their bold captain captivated more and more
the hearts of the bandits, to whose eyes tears came&mdash;tears
which they would not have shed on hearing the pitiful wailings
of poor peasants from whom they had stolen the small store
with which they had hoped to support their families; of unhappy
parents whose daughter was about to be their victim;
of the sad wife whom their swords had condemned to widowhood;
of the weak children whom they had made orphans,
without means of subsistence.</p>

<p>"Hear me, brothers," continued the Vengador; "from to-day,
war to the strong and help to the weak! If we go near
the poor, it must be only for the purpose of alleviating their
misery with what we shall have taken from the powerful.
Have any of you daughters or a wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied one of the robbers; "I have a daughter who
is worth more than those of the king, and I love her more than
the apple of my eyes."</p>

<p>"I have a wife," answered another, "and, although a
peasant, she is of more value than the most noble dame in
Castile. For this I love her as well as people say the son of
the Grandee of Vivar loves the daughter of De Gormaz."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what would you do if your daughter were torn
away from you?"</p>

<p>"Anger of God! If such were done, I would never rest till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>my dagger was buried in the heart of him who took her from
me, even were he hid in the bowels of the earth, even if he
fled to the ends of the world! Brother captain, say no more,
for God's sake; thinking only of such a thing makes my blood
boil."</p>

<p>"And you," he said, turning to the other, "what would you
do if your wife were taken from you and dishonoured?"</p>

<p>"If such happened," he exclaimed, placing his hand on his
dagger with an instinctive movement, and his eyes flashing
fire, "my sword would pierce a hundred hearts and then my
own! But for what reason do you ask us such questions,
captain?"</p>

<p>"Because I wish to put you on your guard,&mdash;you on account
of your wife, and you, of your daughter, if they live in this
district; for there is in it a ruffianly count, who carries
off wives from their husbands, and daughters from their
fathers."</p>

<p>"Who, then, is that count?" asked all the bandits, full of
indignation.</p>

<p>"The Count of Carrion," replied Martin, repressing with
difficulty the joy he felt on seeing how successfully he had
disposed his companions to aid him in his projects of vengeance.
"The Count of Carrion," he continued, "is the most
cruel, the most treacherous, and the worst of men; when you
return home to clasp your daughters or your wives to your
hearts, perchance you will find that he has stolen them from
you."</p>

<p>"May the earth open and may we sink into hell, if we
suffer such a wretch to live any longer!" exclaimed the robbers;
and Martin continued, more warmly and solemnly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, comrades, let the Count of Carrion die, if we
ourselves do not desire to die like the Raposo and the greater
part of his band. It is that count who has sacrificed our
brothers, for to him is due the creation of the brotherhood of
the Salvadores."</p>

<p>"Let us attack his castle!" all exclaimed; "let us bury our
swords in the breast of that traitor count!"</p>

<p>"But Don Suero, for such is his name, will be able to say
to us, that if he carries off young girls and married women, we
also do the same; that if he attacks and wounds poor people,
and deprives them of their means of subsistence, we also do
the same."</p>

<p>"But from this day forward we shall not do such things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Let us all now swear that we will plunge our daggers in the
breast of any comrade who dares to commit such crimes."
Thus spoke the bandit who had a daughter.</p>

<p>Without the slightest hesitation, they all then took a solemn
oath, that in future they would not ill-treat women, or injure
and rob the poor and helpless.</p>

<p>Martin now began to feel weak on account of the quantity
of blood he had lost, and considered that he should not delay
any longer the binding of his wounds.</p>

<p>One of the bandits gathered some herbs that were abundant
in that country, and applied them to the wounds of his captain,
having first washed them in water brought in a helmet from
an adjacent spring. They were bound up with bandages,
made from a handkerchief which was torn up for that purpose.</p>

<p>The much reduced band of the Vengador rested under the
trees of the thick wood, where the horses found abundant
pasture; and when the vesper bells began to ring in the surrounding
villages, the bandits mounted their horses and,
according to the orders of their captain, continued their way
towards the Sierra de Oca.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE DE VIVAR FAMILY RECEIVED LETTERS FROM
THE KING, DON FERNANDO</p></blockquote>


<p>A few days after the events which we have related in preceding
chapters, Diego Lainez and his family, including Rodrigo,
were seated at table in the castle of Vivar. All were in good
spirits, all were eating with excellent appetites, except the last-mentioned,
who in vain endeavoured to take part in the general
joyousness; but the smile departed suddenly from his lips, as
if there came to drive it away some sad memories, which the
most trivial phrases of those present seemed to awake in his
soul.</p>

<p>Teresa, who was observing her son, saw his inquietude and
sadness, and from that moment she shared them with him;
for the feelings of a son reflect themselves in a mother,
especially when she is as good as the mother of Rodrigo was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"My son," she said to the youth, who was then buried in
thought, "why are you so sad when we all have such reason
to be joyous, especially you, who have washed off the blot that
stained our honour? What is the cause of your sadness?"</p>

<p>"Mother," replied Rodrigo, "have you not heard that
Casilda, the solitary of the lake of San Vicente, shares her
home with a noble maiden who also has gone to bury herself
in that solitary place?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That maiden is Ximena Gome."</p>

<p>"Let her then, my son, weep in solitude over the perfidy of
her father, let her consecrate some of her days to God, and to
the care of the poor invalids who resort to the lake to seek
their health, for grief finds its first consolations in God and in
those who suffer. If she loves you still, of which I have no
doubt, her grief will pass away, and her love will remain; for
true love is eternal, and grief, no matter how deep, is
transitory."</p>

<p>"Do you believe, my mother, that Ximena can love the
slayer of her father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, for in killing her father you gave another
proof of your noble character, and Ximena herself would have
abhorred you if she saw you regard with indifference the stain
which her father had cast on the honour of yours."</p>

<p>"Do you not know that, before she quitted the court, she
demanded vengeance against me from the king, supposing that
I had wrongfully killed her father?"</p>

<p>"Yes," interposed Diego Lainez, who until then did not
wish to interrupt the conversation between his wife and son;
"and such is the duty of every daughter. The king, however,
is too wise and just to believe such a thing, and to punish one
who not only committed no offence, but rather added fresh
lustre to his honour."</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding, my father, I fear that the king is much
displeased with us, for the question regarding Calahorra is now
the foremost one, and he has not asked your advice, as he
always was in the habit of doing in similar cases."</p>

<p>Just as Rodrigo said this, a servant entered, announcing the
arrival of a messenger from the king, from whom he brought
letters for Diego Lainez and Rodrigo.</p>

<p>A perceptible uneasiness came upon the countenance of
Diego, as well as on those of his wife and son. A moment
afterwards the old man was reading a sheet of parchment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
upon which was the royal seal, and the young man was reading
a similar one. This is what the first contained:&mdash;</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Much honoured Diego Lainez, the King of Leon and Castile salutes
you, whom he loves the most of all his subjects. Know that we await you
impatiently in our Alcazar, for it is our wish that you should devote your
wisdom and prudence to the education of the princes, our sons, as we informed
you but a short time ago, in the presence of the cavaliers of our
court. Pay attention to your health till it is quite restored from the injury
which the wounds made on your honour must have caused it, and as those
have been healed, receive the congratulations which, on that account, we
offer you.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The King</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The second letter, directed to Rodrigo, was conceived in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To you, Rodrigo Diaz, a good son as well as a good knight, the king
sends his greetings; be it known to you that the King of Aragon disputes
with us the possession of Calahorra, alleging injustice on the part of the
king our father, who made it over to us of his own good will, when God
was pleased to call him to Himself. And as we have agreed to confide
the decision of the dispute to the valour of two cavaliers, one to be named
by us, and the other by the King of Aragon, it is our will that you shall be
he who is to defend our rights, combating with Martin Gonzalez, who has
been appointed to defend those which Don Ramiro claims to possess.
You have given proof of being an honourable and valiant knight, by slaying
De Gormaz to avenge the insult offered to your father's and to your
honour, and we doubt not but that the enterprise, which we confide to you,
shall come to a successful issue.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The King</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Martin Gonzalez," exclaimed Rodrigo, trembling with joy,
"is then the champion of Aragon! Father, Calahorra shall
remain to Don Fernando, and I shall have another claim on
Ximena for her love. Let God put me front to front with
Martin Gonzalez, in order that my sword may cause to bite
the dust the only man I hate in this world, now that De
Gormaz is dead&mdash;a man whom Ximena also abhors."</p>

<p>"Yes, my son," replied Diego, participating in the delight
of his son, both on account of the honours which both of them
had received from the king, and the enterprise which had been
entrusted to Rodrigo, in which he was likely to gain still
further glory. "Yes, you shall fight for your king and for
your love, and you shall conquer; do not doubt of it, Rodrigo.
To-morrow we shall return to the court, where happier days
await us than those which we recently experienced in it."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, both parents embraced their son, for Teresa
also shared in the satisfaction of her husband and Rodrigo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
The latter, indeed, was about to engage in a fight in which one
of the combatants was almost certain to lose his life, but
Teresa trusted in the valour of her son, and at that period the
sentiment of honour was superior to all affections, to all fears,
to all interests. Then the mother who most loved her son
was the very one who most ardently desired to see him
engaged in some honourable and hazardous enterprise, even
though the chances of gaining honour were less than those of
losing life.</p>

<p>The reader, who doubtless remembers the interview between
Ximena and Rodrigo in the halls of the Alcazar, will also
remember the fears which both of them entertained, that Don
Gome might bestow the hand of his daughter on another
man. Let us see if such fears were well founded.</p>

<p>Before the battle of Atapuerca, and when enmity was
commencing between Diego Lainez and Don Gome, the latter
was sent to the court of Aragon, in reality as the ambassador
of Don Fernando, but he imagined that it was a kind of exile,
brought about by the artifices of De Vivar. Martin Gonzalez,
who was one of the most powerful grandees of Aragon, gave
him hospitality in his mansion, and entertained him magnificently,
apparently for no reason but to return the marks of
friendship which he had received from the count, some time
before, at Gormaz, where he had been at the celebration of a
tournament, in which were engaged both Castilian and
Aragonian knights. Martin then saw Ximena, and was
charmed with her beauty and prudence; but he did not
demand her hand, believing that it would not be accorded to
him, as he was aware that it had been promised to Rodrigo.
However, whilst Don Gome was enjoying his hospitality,
Martin Gonzalez discovered the recent bitter feelings which he
entertained towards De Vivar, and he believed that the time
had arrived for winning what he so ardently desired. He
fanned the flames of discord between Diego Lainez and Don
Gome, strengthening by means of calumny the belief which
the latter entertained, that he owed his disfavour at the court
to the artifices of De Vivar. Then, when he had sufficiently
worked on the mind of Don Gome, he asked him for the
hand of Ximena, which was granted, on condition, however,
that she should be in no way forced to grant it against her
will, for, with all his faults, De Gormaz, as we have said before,
loved his daughter, and, although he had then resolved that
she should not marry Rodrigo, he did not intend that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
should become the wife of another, except with her own free
consent. These infamous schemes, which were the principal
causes of the division between the two families, were known
to Ximena and to Rodrigo, and that is why they both entertained
a deep hatred towards Martin Gonzalez, and certainly
that hatred was legitimate and just.</p>

<p>We do not wish to leave the castle of Vivar without knowing
the condition of affairs between the squire and his two
sweethearts, for which reason we shall enter a chamber, which
must be that of Fernan, for he is in it, and a lance and other
instruments belonging to his profession are suspended on its
walls.</p>

<p>The valiant squire must be in very low spirits, for when he
is not so he talks, when in company, as much as four, or if
alone, sings ballads of love or chivalry; but now he is silent,
with his head bent down, as if buried in deep and disagreeable
thought. Another servitor, however, enters the apartment,
and from his words we shall perchance learn something of
that which we desire to know.</p>

<p>"On my soul," said the page, for such he was, "you are
now just as much what you used to be as I am a bishop.
What are you doing with your head sunk on your breast, and
so miserable, when such glad news has come to our lords and
masters?"</p>

<p>"Tell me, then, Alvar, what news have come?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you willingly as much as I know. I swear that
the tidings must be good&mdash;and so good that my masters
gave the messengers who brought them presents so valuable,
that if they are not worth at least more than a hundred ounces
of good silver, may the saints forsake me at the hour of my
death!"</p>

<p>"But will you not tell me, accursed chatterer that you are,
what the news is which the messenger has brought?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Fernan, I will, and I am just coming to it. But
what good has it done you to visit so often the witch of the
torrent, if you have not yet learned to know things beforehand,
an art in which people say she excels?"</p>

<p>"I vow by Judas Iscariot that I'll throw you out of the
window if you don't cease talking such nonsense, and get out
of this at once."</p>

<p>Alvar stepped backwards on seeing the threatening gesture
of the impatient squire, for he knew that it was the habit of
Fernan to accompany his words with acts, to which his ribs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
almost broken more than once by the squire, could testify.
As the reader has already perceived, the page was one of those
young men who are so fond of circumlocutions that they go to
the grain, as sparrows, through the straw. We have corresponding
types in our own times, as may be often seen in meetings
of Parliament, in which is often heard the cry, "To the grain,
to the grain!" or "Question, question," which is the same
thing.</p>

<p>Thanks, then, to the threats of Fernan, the page related,
without any more roundabout expressions, what had brought
the messenger of Don Fernando; adding, as we already know,
that both Diego and Rodrigo had decided to set out for the
court on the following day.</p>

<p>"I am much pleased to hear that," said Fernan, "for my life
at Vivar is but a lingering death, since that ungrateful Mayorica
repays my love with scratches and insults, and that vixen of an
Aldonza shuts the door in my face."</p>

<p>"Then you love them, Fernan?" said the page, much
surprised.</p>

<p>"And I must love them, I fear, in spite of the fact that they
treat me worse than a captive Moor."</p>

<p>"By the soul of my grandfather, he who goes on in that way
deserves a hundred lashes. Oh, how vain are the intentions of
lovers! Why don't you swear, you unfortunate man, that as
long as you live you'll have nothing more to do with women?"</p>

<p>"What do you desire, Alvar? Man proposes and woman
disposes. I was born with such weaknesses, and I fear that I
shall die with them."</p>

<p>"Conquer these inclinations of yours, Fernan."</p>

<p>"It's not easy to do that. However, I swear to you, friend
Alvar, that my eyes are opened with regard to the fair sex, and
I'll do my best to be done with them from this time forward."</p>

<p>"If you don't do so soon, I tell you again, as I have
already said, that you will deserve a hundred good lashes."</p>

<p>"It is easily seen, Alvar, that you have no heart. You
never knew, and don't know now, what love is."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the page, heaving a deep sigh; "I know it but
too well, friend Fernan. If we carried our hearts on our
foreheads, you would see mine, and it would move you to
compassion."</p>

<p>"By Judas Iscariot! what do you tell me, friend Alvar?
You in love?"</p>

<p>"Don't be surprised, Fernan, for one should be made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
stone not to fall in love with the tyrannical and gentle maiden
for whom I sigh."</p>

<p>"Tell me, who is this sovereign beauty?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will tell you, Fernan. You and your master
brought her to Vivar"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Explain quickly what you mean!" exclaimed the squire,
becoming suddenly very angry again.</p>

<p>"I tell you," hastened to answer Alvar, fearing the look
of Fernan, "that Beatrice, the maiden whom you and Don
Rodrigo rescued at the inn, has me almost dead with love."</p>

<p>"You will soon be dead by my hands!" cried the squire,
rushing at the page and furiously seizing him by the throat.
"What is that you dare to say, ill-born lout? You in love with
Beatrice! you dare to place your eyes where I have fixed
mine!"</p>

<p>"Fernan, Fernan, let me loose! you are choking me with
your hands of iron! If I had known that you were in love
with her, I should have had no more thought of loving her than
of turning Moor."</p>

<p>Fernan let go the page, feeling convinced that he had set
his eyes on Beatrice, not knowing that doing so would offend
him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I love her," said the squire; "and, except my master,
no one has any right to interfere with me, for my lance made
the fellows that were carrying her off bite the dust. Although
up to the present she has showed herself insensible to my
prayers, she shall learn how worthy I am of serving her, and
will yield to me, so that I may requite myself for the cruelty
of Mayorica."</p>

<p>The page found it hard to give up the conquest of the
maiden who had been rescued from Don Suero, but he found
the hands of Fernan harder; for that reason he promised him
solemnly that he would not expose himself again to his anger
by paying attentions to Beatrice. The thrice enamoured
squire was satisfied with this, and both continued to converse
amiably, when they heard some persons exclaim in an
adjacent room&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<p>"Daughter of my soul!"</p>

<p>To these exclamations followed sobs and repeated kisses.</p>

<p>The page and the squire proceeded thither, and found
Beatrice in the arms of a peasant, advanced in years.</p>

<p>It was the father of the maiden, who had been informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
that she was in the castle of Vivar, and who had not come
sooner to clasp her in his arms for the reason which his own
words will explain.</p>

<p>"My daughter, how were you rescued from that accursed
Don Suero? How is it that I find you here?" asked the
elderly man; and she began immediately to inform him of
what had happened since she had been torn from his side.</p>

<p>The poor farmer shed tears of gratitude on learning the
protection that had been given to his child by Rodrigo and
the other inmates of the castle.</p>

<p>"Ah," he exclaimed, "God will bless those who have
restored a daughter to her father; God will protect the good
cavalier who drew his sword in defence of the oppressed,
and for the punishment of a wicked tyrant."</p>

<p>But as Beatrice was impatient to learn what had happened
to those who were her companions when returning from the
pilgrimage, and what had taken place afterwards at Carrion,
her father hastened to relieve her uneasiness and anxiety.</p>

<p>"The father of Martin," he said, "was killed by a stab
which he received in the horrible fight from one of the
retainers of Don Suero. Martin embraced his dead body and
cried out, weeping&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Father, father! your son will avenge you!'</p>

<p>"He then turned to your mother and to me, and added,
'Your daughter shall also be avenged; I swear it by the love
I always had for her, and by the salvation of my father's soul.'
He then disappeared, and no one since then has learned
where he is."</p>

<p>"But was he wounded?" asked Beatrice anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, my daughter," replied her father.</p>

<p>And the girl murmured in a low tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thank thee, O my God! I am still worthy of him&mdash;I
trust in his love."</p>

<p>These words were a dagger-blow to Fernan, who doubtless
believed that the lover of Beatrice had fallen in the combat,
and that the maiden had already forgotten him. It was
little less for Alvar, who, although he had promised the squire
to renounce his pretensions to the love of Beatrice, still
nursed the idea of following them on, acting prudently behind
the back of the squire. Thus it was that they looked at
each other gloomily, and, with a certain kind of despair,
Fernan said to the page&mdash;</p>

<p>"It appears to me, friend Alvar, that we fail in courtesy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
and good manners, listening to conversations which do not
concern us."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Alvar.</p>

<p>And although Beatrice and her father told them that
they did not inconvenience them in the slightest, each one
retired in a different direction, Fernan muttering&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ungrateful, ungrateful women! The more one loves
them the worse is he treated. But I, curse me! am myself
the cause of the misfortunes which have come upon me,
for I have enraged Mayorica, looking out for too much love.
There are certainly more than two women in Spain for each
man, and I swear by the soul of Beelzebub that I am right
in my calculation; but as women are so stupid that they won't
listen to reason, why should I not resign myself to their
foolishness, and enjoy the love of one of them. Well, then,
from this day forward I shall devote myself heart and soul to
Mayorica, and let the others see what a treasure of love they
have lost in me. Mayorica is fierce when I annoy her, but
kind and affectionate when I please her. Oh, Mayorica of
my eyes! you shall not have to complain again of your lover,
for if you guard your honour for him, he will do the same
for you."</p>

<p>And Alvar&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a fool I was to fall in love, when I saw how things
were going with Fernan. It is a sad thing to find the position
occupied, when for the first time a man bestows his affections
on a woman. They seem to be born provided with lovers,
just as they are with arms and legs. O Lord, what a blessing
it would be to men if you had created them without hearts!"</p>

<p>The old man continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"We arrived at Carrion, and on the following day your
mother was stricken down with an illness which nearly cost
her her life. She called out for you in her delirium, and she
could not be consoled. Then the news of your safety arrived,
and her health improved so much that I was able to leave her
to come to you."</p>

<p>"Let us set out at once, father, for I must return to my
mother. No danger threatens me at Carrion, for the sword
of my deliverer deprived the count of life."</p>

<p>"It deprived him of his prey, my daughter, but not of his
life, for Don Suero returned to his castle the next day, and
has recovered from his wounds, which he says he received
fighting with a band of robbers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then what shall we do, father?" exclaimed Beatrice;
"what shall we do to protect you and my mother from his
anger, for having thwarted his criminal intentions, and to
protect me from a fresh attempt on his part? But, ah! do
not be uneasy, father, go and bring hither my mother; let us
fly from the estates of the count. I am certain that the
generous and noble family, to whom we owe our safety, will
give us a small piece of ground to farm, a humble refuge, in
which we shall be able to enjoy a tranquil life, and show our
gratitude to, and bless our benefactors every day."</p>

<p>Beatrice was not wrong in trusting to the generosity of the
lord and lady of Vivar. A few days after, she and her parents
were installed, content and happy, in a small farmhouse,
situated at a short distance from the castle, surrounded by
fields which Pero Lopez, for such was the name of the girl's
father, was ploughing with a pair of mules which, a short time
before, had been feeding in the stables of Diego Lainez.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">THE COMBAT BETWEEN RODRIGO AND MARTIN GONZALEZ</p></blockquote>


<p>The cocks were crowing in Vivar, when Diego Lainez and
Rodrigo, accompanied by squires and pages, amongst whom
were Fernan and Alvar, started for Calahorra. All the roads
were alive with people, who were making their way towards
that town, desirous of being present at the combat between
Martin Gonzalez and the knight of Castile and Leon; for the
champion of the King of Aragon enjoyed the reputation of
being a doughty cavalier, and it was believed, not without
good reason, that, to confront him, Don Fernando would select
the bravest of his cavaliers. The morning was beautiful, the
road had been recently put into good condition by order of
the king, who had proceeded to Calahorra, and everything
contributed to make the journey pleasant, the district then
being as full of animation and life as it was dull and gloomy
during the greater part of the year. This conduced to the
fact that Diego and Rodrigo arrived at Calahorra, preserving
the pleasant feelings which the letters of the king had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with them. More than once the brave youth heard the good
wishes which the passers-by expressed for the success of the
champion of Don Fernando, although they did not know who
he was; and, far from feeling any fear as to the result of the
contest, he became more and more confident, and felt sure
that he would be the victor, notwithstanding the fact that the
wounds which he had received from Don Gome were not yet
quite healed.</p>

<p>Diego and his son proceeded, immediately on their arrival
in Calahorra, to the temporary residence of the king. Don
Fernando received both of them most warmly, and Diego could
not forbear feeling, with great pleasure, how much brighter his
honour then shone than when he was last at the court.</p>

<p>"Sire," said Rodrigo, as much moved as his father, "you
have conferred on me an honour which I do not deserve, and
which the best cavalier in the world might well envy. If I had
done anything to merit it, you would now only be paying me a
debt; but, not having done such, I owe you one, and I am
longing for the moment when I can repay it."</p>

<p>"That moment, Rodrigo, is very near: this very day the
place for the combat shall be arranged and the conditions
settled, so that the fight may begin at sunrise, as you are so
anxious for it.</p>

<p>"Would to God, Rodrigo," continued Don Fernando, throwing
his arms round the neck of the young man, "that I had a
son like you! I would give my crown to have one as brave
and good as the son of Diego Lainez."</p>

<p>Diego raised his rugged and noble brow, with a movement
caused by paternal pride, and at that moment he would not
have exchanged his happiness for a king's throne.</p>

<p>"You have such a son, sire," replied Rodrigo, with much
modesty. "Don Sancho will be a brave cavalier and a prince
worthy to succeed his father on the throne of Castile and Leon.
Sire, ask the few Moors and Christians that were left alive at
Atapuerca, who the valiant cavalier was that struck terror into
the army of the King of Navarre, and they will tell you that he
was a beardless youth, as cool as he was daring, as fearless as
he was skilful in the use of his sword; they will also tell you that
he was Don Sancho, your son. The laws of the duel authorise
the champion to select a second according to his pleasure, and
I, using that right, select as my second the Infante Don Sancho
if such a choice does not displease you and your family."</p>

<p>"The Infante will feel honoured by your selection, which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
as his father, approve of. Go and take some repose, Rodrigo,
and prepare yourself for to-morrow's combat. And you,
honoured Diego, from this day forward shall reside in my
Alcazar, for I desire to have you near me, so that you may
assist me with your advice, and also to have you near my sons,
that, from your experience and loyalty, they may become endowed
with all the good qualities which are so conspicuous in
your son."</p>

<p>"Sire," said Diego, "permit me to kiss your hand."</p>

<p>"I give you, not alone my hand, but also my heart;" and
he embraced the old man affectionately.</p>

<p>The following day dawned, peaceful and beautiful as the one
which had preceded it, and an unusual animation could be
noticed in the town. Ladies and cavaliers, citizens and rustics,
all, indeed, were proceeding to a place at the junction of the
rivers Cidacos and Ebro, where, in a beautiful meadow, had
been erected the enclosure in which the combat was to take
place between Rodrigo Diaz and Martin Gonzalez. The circumstances
connected with the two champions, and the grave
question which was about to be decided, raised to the highest
degree the public curiosity: it was not a private affair, but a
matter that concerned two kings, and in which two powerful
kingdoms were interested. As to the knights selected to settle
it, Martin Gonzalez was one of the most valiant warriors of the
period; and the killing of Don Gome de Gormaz had given to
Rodrigo Diaz extraordinary celebrity, for the count had been
considered invincible, and he who conquered him had a just
right to be looked on as also invincible. The love affairs of
Rodrigo and Ximena had already become public property, and
also the pretensions of Martin Gonzalez to the hand of the
orphan; therefore it was believed that the Castilian champion
was about to fight, at the same time, against the sustainer of
the rights of the King of Aragon, and also against him who had
endeavoured to snatch from him the love of Ximena&mdash;the love
which was his glory, his hope, and his life.</p>

<p>In the following manner was arranged the place for the
combat: a quadrilateral enclosure had been formed by means
of stakes driven into the ground, and bound together by an
interlacing of branches, the verdure of which gave it the appearance
of a natural hedge. At both sides were placed, on
platforms erected for the purpose, long seats, or thrones; that
on the one side for the royal family, and that on the other for
the umpires of the combat; canvas tents had also been set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
at the extreme ends of the enclosed ground, one for each
champion and his second and squires.</p>

<p>The sun had just risen in the east; the high and luxuriant
trees, which on that side hung over the arena, shaded it from
his rays, which were then very strong, as it was the warmest
season of the year. Multitudes of people pressed round the
enclosure, and spread out for a considerable distance into the
surrounding fields, like a sea, the waves of which were incessantly
agitated. The king occupied the throne arranged
for him, having at his side the queen, Doña Sancha, and his
son, Prince Alonzo; the umpires also occupied the place
allotted to them. They numbered four; two named by Don
Fernando, and two by Don Ramiro. The former were Peransurez
and Arias Gonzalo; and as to the others, history only
says that they were "two very noble and very accomplished
Aragonian cavaliers." On the platform beside them stood
two heralds, with trumpets suspended from their girdles. A
prolonged murmur was heard throughout the multitudes: this
arose when the champions were making their way to the field
of battle. Rodrigo was mounted on a splendid sorrel charger,
with flowing mane and of noble appearance, which had been
presented to him, the day before, by Don Fernando; the
Infante, Don Sancho, accompanied him as his second, and
Fernan and Alvar preceded him, the first as his squire and the
second as his lance-page. If Ximena could have seen him at
that moment, poor maiden, how sad would have been the contest
in her heart between love and the memory of her father!
How brave and haughty stood the son of Diego Lainez, clad
in his strong and brilliant armour! How many fair ladies,
who had felt pity for the orphan, envied also the lot of her who
was loved by Rodrigo!</p>

<p>The horse mounted by Martin Gonzalez was black, and
more fiery even than that of Rodrigo, although not quite as
strongly built: the second of the Aragonian champion was
Don Suero, who, being a friend and relation, had repaired to
the court for that purpose, although he had not yet quite recovered
from the wounds, which, as it was spread abroad, he
had received whilst fighting with a band of robbers. Martin
Gonzalez was also accompanied by a squire and lance-page,
and his armour was white.</p>

<p>The heralds sounded their trumpets, and that loud murmur
which, by its increasing volume, showed that the numerous
spectators were at the height of their arguments regarding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
combat about to commence, became silent, as if it were the
trumpet of the last judgment that was heard. Then a proclamation
was read, commanding all present to remain silent
and motionless until the termination of the combat, under
penalty of "<i>losing their goods and the eyes from their faces</i>,"
whether men or women, young men or old men, nobles or
peasants. When the reading of the proclamation had ended,
the two champions advanced until they nearly met, and Martin
Gonzalez called out three times&mdash;</p>

<p>"Calahorra for Don Ramiro!"</p>

<p>To which cry Rodrigo replied, also calling out three
times&mdash;</p>

<p>"Calahorra for Don Fernando!"</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, Martin Gonzalez threw a glove on the
ground, which Rodrigo took up, and then threw down another,
which, in his turn, his adversary hastened to pick up. The
two champions, with their squires and pages, then retired
to their respective tents, and the seconds only remained in
the enclosure, where they were sworn before the umpires to
loyally do their duty. This oath having been taken, Don
Sancho and the Count of Carrion proceeded successively to
the tents of Rodrigo and of Martin, in order to examine the
arms of the combatants, and to ratify the conditions of the
duel. When these matters were adjusted, the champions
again made their appearance on the arena, and they were
asked by the oldest of the umpires&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do ye swear to fight according to the laws of cavaliers,
using no foul play or witchcraft, either in blows or in
arms?"</p>

<p>"We swear it!" answered at the same time both Rodrigo
Diaz and Martin Gonzalez.</p>

<p>"If ye thus act, may God and His saints aid ye; if not, be
ye accursed as evil-doers and traitors, as ye would then be,
and descend to hell, where Judas the traitor is!"</p>

<p>When this had been spoken, the champions, who had
advanced to the middle of the arena, retired to the extreme
ends of it, and took their shields and lances, which their
respective squires and pages handed to them, placing themselves
in position to rush to the encounter, whilst the judges
were marking the ground.</p>

<p>"The <i>Ave Maria</i>, the <i>Ave Maria</i>!" cried out the
heralds.</p>

<p>And all the spectators uncovered their heads, and recited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the <i>Ave Maria</i>. When it was finished, the blast of a trumpet
was heard, and the champions rushed onward.</p>

<p>The first assault was terrible. Both lances struck simultaneously
the shields of strong steel, and the violent impact
caused both horses and riders to reel, notwithstanding their
strength. Scarcely giving themselves time to recover from
this first shock, the combatants again rushed against each
other, and the lance of Rodrigo struck harmlessly the shield
of Martin, whilst that of the latter, glancing off from the
shield, broke the armour on his left arm, and wounded the
youth above the elbow. The Castilian champion had very
considerable advantage over the Aragonese in agility and
dexterity, but was much inferior to him in strength. The
blood of Rodrigo stained the accoutrements of his horse, and
dolorous cries, mingled with others of joy, were heard amid
the crowds that were spectators of the combat. The knight
of Vivar, however, far from being discouraged by this mischance,
became more and more excited with anger, and
endeavoured to have satisfaction by again rushing on Martin,
who, however, warded off the blow with his shield, for
Rodrigo had not only against him his own inferior strength,
but also that of his steed, which swerved to one side through
the impetus and force of the blow. The same tactics were
repeated several times, without any advantage to either combatant;
but it was evident that the contest could not last
very much longer, for both cavaliers were fighting rashly and
recklessly. They took their positions for another charge,
which all the spectators believed must be the final one, and,
burying their spurs in the sides of their horses, they rode on
at full speed, and the encounter was so violent that both lances
were broken into fragments, and the steed of Rodrigo was
thrown on his haunches. Then Martin Gonzalez drew his
sword and raised it above the head of his unarmed rival.
Another cry of horror arose amid the crowds around, notwithstanding
the severe penalties that had been proclaimed
against such manifestations, and all eyes turned, with pitying
glances, towards Diego Lainez, who, with other cavaliers,
occupied one of the platforms erected inside the palisade,
in order that noble dames and cavaliers might be able to
witness the combat. No one could accuse the champion of
Aragon of foul play or treachery for acting thus, for he was
only taking advantage of a favourable opportunity to strike
his opponent, and in such circumstances this was permitted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
All, however, trembled, not so much for losing Calahorra as
for losing Rodrigo, who promised to be one of the bravest
cavaliers of Castile and Leon.</p>

<p>When Rodrigo saw the sword of Martin above his head,
he sprung to his feet with incredible rapidity, and avoiding
thus the stroke of his adversary, which wounded the horse,
as if chance thus punished it for its weakness, he quickly
drew his sword and plunged it into the breast of the charger
of Martin Gonzalez. He was then in a similar position to
that in which Rodrigo had been; but the youth, far from
imitating him, stopped and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Arise, and let us fight on our feet, for our swords must
now do what our lances have not been able to accomplish."</p>

<p>Thunders of applause were the recompense which the
spectators bestowed on Rodrigo for his generous conduct.
Both knights put themselves on their guard, and then attacked
each other with desperate fury. In vain did Martin endeavour
to render unavailing the defence which his shield afforded to
Rodrigo by trying to get at his sides; but the champion of
Don Fernando avoided all his strokes by his dexterity and
agility, in the same way that his opponent was taking advantage,
in every way in his power, of his superior strength.
Rodrigo took his sword in both his hands, notwithstanding
the embarrassment caused by his shield, and was about to
bring it down on the helmet of Martin Gonzalez, when he
held up his shield almost horizontally. The helmet remained
uninjured, but the shield was broken to pieces, and Martin
consequently remained without any protection except the coat
of mail with which he, as well as his opponent, was covered.</p>

<p>Martin Gonzalez believed himself lost, and all his friends
shared in this fear; Rodrigo, however, gave another proof
that the noblest blood of Castile ran in his veins.</p>

<p>"Let us fight with uncovered breasts!" he exclaimed; and
he threw his shield far from him.</p>

<p>If the face of the Aragonese knight had not been hidden
by his visor, the spectators of that sanguinary scene could
have seen it covered with the blush of shame.</p>

<p>The combat continued, ever more obstinate, more bloody,
more ferocious. Anger blinded Rodrigo, and gave advantage
to his adversary, who remained much cooler. Martin observed
this, and endeavoured to win the victory by enraging more
and more the young cavalier; and, according to the "Chronicle
of the Cid," he said to him&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was an evil day for you when you entered into this
contest with me, for you shall never marry Doña Ximena
Gome, whom you love so much. You shall not return to
Castile alive."</p>

<p>To which Rodrigo answered, according to the same
chronicle&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don Martin Gonzalez, you know, as a knight should, that
such words are not for an occasion like this; we are here to
fight with our swords and not with idle words."</p>

<p>"Then let us finish quickly," said Martin in a low voice,
"for Ximena awaits me with open arms."</p>

<p>These words were scarcely uttered when the sword of
Rodrigo was darted at his visage, and, breaking the front part
of the helmet, it entered his mouth with such force that the
point came out through the back of his neck.</p>

<p>A providential chastisement. The calumniator, Martin
Gonzalez, was punished where he had most sinned.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic cries resounded on all sides.</p>

<p>"Calahorra for Don Fernando!" cried out the heralds three
times; and no one came forward to maintain the contrary.</p>

<p>The umpires then declared the result of the combat, and
adjudged to Don Fernando the disputed town.</p>

<p>The king descended at once to the arena, embraced
Rodrigo, took off his armour with his own hands, and led
him off.</p>

<p>A short time after, the brave youth entered the town, amid
the enthusiastic cheers of the multitude, and his father and
the king were seen to shed tears of joy.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">OF AN UNEXPECTED VISIT WHICH XIMENA RECEIVED IN
HER RETREAT</p></blockquote>


<p>For some time the king, Don Fernando, had been thinking
of changing his court to Burgos, partly in order to be nearer
to the frontiers which the Moors of Aragon were continually
devastating, and thus be able to keep them in check; and
partly in order that the Castilians might not think that he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
undue preference to the kingdom of Leon. He determined to
carry out this project as soon as the question regarding
Calahorra was decided by the single combat between Rodrigo
Diaz and Martin Gonzalez. The desire to extinguish at its
very commencement the enmity between the partisans of the
houses of Gormaz and Vivar, which he believed was about to
spring up in Castile, also induced him to hasten this change.
Don Fernando considered that the best way to cut short the
existence of those two bodies of partisans was to unite
Ximena with Rodrigo, but this presented serious difficulties
on the side of the maiden; he, however, proposed to himself
to overcome them, not alone actuated by the desire of seeing
his states in a condition of tranquillity, but also by that of
making Rodrigo happy, for he knew he could never be so
without Ximena.</p>

<p>We shall leave that wise and prudent monarch on his way
to Castile, and learn something concerning the solitaries of
the lake of San Vicente.</p>

<p>Ximena had believed that in solitude, in prayer, in
penitence, and in the service of her afflicted fellow-creatures,
she could forget Rodrigo, and find tranquillity and resignation,
of which she was so much in need; she had, however,
completely deceived herself, for when love has struck deep
roots in a heart, it resists all violence, it resists all waves, it
resists all storms. Can such a love die, unless those who
experience it also die?&mdash;a love which had its birth in the
cradles of two children, which grew up with their growth in
their paternal homes, amid the flowers and the butterflies of the
meadows, beneath the trees which shaded the avenues of
their native place, and under the eyes of devoted mothers?
How could this paradise, which loving souls dream of, be
renounced?</p>

<p>In vain had Ximena striven against her love for Rodrigo;
in vain had she invoked the terrible memory of her father in
order to give it the place in her soul which the remembrance
of Rodrigo occupied; in vain had she asked their assistance
from the holy maiden and from the affectionate and faithful
old woman who had accompanied her into that solitude, in
order to tear from her heart that enduring, deep, immense
love. On all sides she found incentives to that love, everything
seemed to conspire to strengthen in her the remembrance
of it. One day there arrived on the shores of the lake a
young invalid, accompanied by a youth who called her by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
sweet name of wife, who lavished loving cares on her, who
became sad when he saw her sad, and joyful when she was
joyful; who surrounded her with an atmosphere of affection,
emanating from his words, from his looks, from his every
action, and Ximena remembered that such was the love she
had dreamed of, that such a husband she had seen in Rodrigo.
Ah! then she could realise how miserable is a woman who
has no husband to protect her weakness or to sustain her
when she is cast down by physical or mental pain! Another
day she was wandering through the shady groves that
bordered the lake, and this brought to her mind the time when
she and Rodrigo wandered through the woods which surrounded
the castle of Gormaz; and every fountain, brook, or
flower-covered meadow which she saw, reminded her of some
other fountain, brook, or meadow, with which were connected
memories of Rodrigo.</p>

<p>In this struggle between love and the blood-stained shade
of her father, the former was gaining the mastery more and
more as time went on. But if Rodrigo still loved her, as
once he did, how could he refrain from seeing her? how was
it that, in order to do so, he did not travel the short distance
which separated Vivar from the lake of San Vicente, as in
former days he had journeyed the long distance between Vivar
and San Estéban of Gormaz? All the projects of hatred, of
revenge, of oblivion; all the endeavours of Ximena to forget
him who had slain her father, had resulted in the girl becoming
wearied by her struggles against love. After a night during
which she was tortured by horrible dreams and nightmares,
she arose from her humble bed,&mdash;the bed in which she had
shed so many tears and abandoned herself to so many sad
reflections,&mdash;and knelt down before an image of the Virgin of
the Dolours, to address to heaven her morning prayer, as the
birds were doing, that sang in the trees which, with their aged
trunks and leafy boughs, protected the rustic hermitage.</p>

<p>"Mother of the unfortunate, consolation of afflicted souls!"
she cried, raising to the holy image her hands and her eyes wet
with tears, "console and sustain me, that I may not succumb
to the weight of my tribulations! Have pity on my tortures,
apply the balsam of thy grace to the wounds of my heart!
Pray to thy Son to have mercy on me!"</p>

<p>Ximena had scarcely finished her short prayer when Lambra&mdash;who
had gone to the door of the hermitage to see if Casilda,
who had set out at daybreak to console and succour the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of a poor and infirm shepherd, was returning&mdash;came hastily to
her mistress, and said to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look, my lady, see those cavaliers who are coming in this
direction."</p>

<p>Ximena allowed herself to be led mechanically by Lambra,
who took her hand and conducted her to the door of their
dwelling-place. As she had said, about twenty well-accoutred
cavaliers were riding along the shore of the lake, on a path
that led to the hermitage, which was erected on the summit of
a hill and overlooked the country for some distance.</p>

<p>These cavaliers were not accompanying a lady. Who were
they, then? Why were they coming to the hermitage?
Ximena asked herself those questions, and her heart beat
quickly, although she did not know what caused it to do so.
The cavaliers were advancing nearer and nearer, and, with
unspeakable surprise, she recognised the king, Don Fernando,
who rode in front. He appeared astonished, in his turn, on
recognising Ximena, when he arrived at the hermitage.</p>

<p>"Ximena!" he exclaimed; "you here?"</p>

<p>And he hastened to dismount.</p>

<p>"You here?" he repeated; "when I believed that you were
in your castle at Gormaz."</p>

<p>"Sire," said the young girl, "I came here, desirous of
finding the tranquillity which was denied me at the court.
Shall I offend you by asking to what circumstance I owe
the happiness of seeing you in these solitudes."</p>

<p>"To my desire of seeing Casilda, for you already know,
Ximena, that since she lost the affection of her father in
order to merit the love of God, she has no protection amongst
men but mine. I bless the moment in which I thought of
undertaking this journey, for at the end of it, instead of
meeting one, I meet two persons whom I love very much."</p>

<p>Those who accompanied the king, as well as Lambra, had
moved away respectfully to some distance from the speakers.</p>

<p>"How is it that I do not find Casilda with you?" asked
Don Fernando.</p>

<p>"You will soon see her, sire," replied the maiden, "for she
has gone to exercise her mission of mercy not far from here."</p>

<p>"I am not alone delighted to see you on account of the
pleasure which your presence always causes me, but also for
the reason that I bring news which I feel sure will be
agreeable to you," said the king, fixing his eyes on her at
the same time, in order to see the effect which his words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
might produce. "You remember that you demanded justice
from me on him who killed your father?"</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten it, sire."</p>

<p>"I have done justice already, Ximena!"</p>

<p>"O my God!" exclaimed the young girl, full of anxiety
and fear. "Sire, explain."</p>

<p>"Rodrigo has been punished as he deserved."</p>

<p>A deadly pallor overspread the face of Ximena, and she
would have fallen on the ground if the king had not supported
her and made her sit down on a rustic bench which stood
near them.</p>

<p>"I engaged him in a single combat with Martin Gonzalez,
certain that it would be one to the death, and I was not
mistaken. The sword of Martin Gonzalez was stained with
the blood of him who shed that of your father."</p>

<p>Ximena uttered a cry of agony, and fell back senseless
against the wall which served as a support for the bench.</p>

<p>"Dueña, dueña!" cried Don Fernando, "bring water
quickly. Your mistress has fainted on being reminded of
her father."</p>

<p>"O my God! may the Mother of Dolours and all the
saints aid me!" cried Lambra, running to fetch what the
king had asked for. "He might have spoken of the living
instead of the dead, when he ought to have seen that it is
only a chance whether she is going to the angels or not."</p>

<p>The dueña brought, in great haste, a vessel of water from a
spring which was very near the hermitage, and bathed the
face of Ximena, who was slowly regaining her senses, whilst
Lambra was saying to the king&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the glorious Saint Isidore, sire, you should be cautious
as to what you say to my mistress, for in one of those faints
she might fly from our hands like a bird. Do you not know,
sire, what ravages the death of her father has made in her
health? and at night she dreams of nothing else, and never
ceases calling out the name of that mad Rodrigo who killed
him."</p>

<p>"Retire, honoured dueña, for she has returned to herself,"
said Don Fernando to Lambra, and she hastened to obey
him.</p>

<p>"He is dead! Rodrigo is dead!" murmured Ximena,
before opening her eyes and becoming aware that the king
stood at her side.</p>

<p>"Ximena," said Don Fernando, "Rodrigo is not dead. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
was he who killed Martin Gonzalez with the point of his
sword."</p>

<p>Ximena could not repress a sudden rush of joy, and did
not even try to conceal her feelings from the king.</p>

<p>"Sire, have compassion on me!" she cried. "Tell me the
truth! Is it certain that Rodrigo is alive, or is it that you
fear to tell me again that he is dead, lest I might fall into
another swoon, such as that which your former words
caused?"</p>

<p>"Ximena, I swear to you that Rodrigo lives, to love you
ever. Are you not glad that he is alive? Are you not glad
that he loves you?"</p>

<p>"Sire, lay the blame of being an unnatural, ungrateful
daughter on me, of being a woman unworthy of the noble
blood that flows in my veins; but I cannot help it. His
life is my life, and without his love I am without hope in this
world. I demanded justice of you against Rodrigo, and I
was not deceiving you, for then it appeared to me that in
obtaining it my entire happiness consisted; but I soon knew
that I was only deceiving myself, that his punishment, which
I asked from you, would be the cause of the deepest misery
to me. My father demanded vengeance from the depths of
his sepulchre, but my love for Rodrigo asked pardon for
him from the bottom of my heart. Ah, sire! God alone and
myself know the terrible combat I have had to sustain, and
the anguish I have had to suffer."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Ximena, that combat and that agony must now
cease. Rodrigo killed your father, but your father had
tarnished the honour of his; Rodrigo desired to fight loyally
and honourably with the Count of Gormaz, but the count
insulted him; then Rodrigo did not kill your father in any
unfair way, but whilst fighting with him, arm to arm and face
to face, as a good knight. This should be sufficient, Ximena,
to remove your scruples and quiet your conscience, so that
you may be the bride of Rodrigo."</p>

<p>"It is impossible, sire, for ordinary people do not reason
thus; and it would be always said that I married the murderer
of my father."</p>

<p>"Ximena, to the eyes of the world you will be the victim
of a tyrannical order&mdash;you will have given your hand to
Rodrigo in obedience to my command; and only you,
Rodrigo, and I shall know that you gave it to him in
accordance with the impulses of your heart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, sire! how shall he and I be ever able to pay you for
the happiness that we shall owe to you?"</p>

<p>"By choosing the queen and me as bride's-lady and
groom's-man at your wedding," replied Don Fernando, with
a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>Ximena knew not how to express her gratitude to the king;
she threw herself on her knees before him and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sire, let me kiss your feet! let me even kiss the ground
where you have stood!"</p>

<p>"Arise, Ximena, for she who, like you, is worthy of
Rodrigo, should kneel only before God."</p>

<p>Just as the king was raising Ximena affectionately from the
ground, Casilda approached, coming from beneath the trees
which grew nearest to the hermitage. Don Fernando, who
loved her as a daughter, and whose kindly feelings were then
much aroused, hastened forward to meet her. Casilda uttered
a cry of joy on seeing him.</p>

<p>"Casilda," said Don Fernando to her, when both he and
the holy maiden had remained silent a short time, as those
who love and respect each other often do, when they meet
after a long absence, "Casilda, I bring you tidings of your
father."</p>

<p>"Of my father?" exclaimed the girl in a joyful tone; and
at the same time a few tears trickled down from her beautiful
and calm eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes; your father has confided to me the hidden feelings
of his heart, in order that I may make them known to you.
Read this, and his words will tell you more than mine."</p>

<p>"To you, who have children, whom you love as I do mine,"
wrote Almenon, having prefaced his letter with the usual
ceremonious phrases and salutations, "to you an unhappy
father appeals, certain that you will understand his feelings
and carry out his wishes. I have been informed that my
daughter did not embrace the religion of the Christians for the
purpose of enjoying the luxury and magnificence of your court,
but in order to live in solitude and poverty, and to consecrate
her life to the service of the poor and afflicted. If I formerly
cursed her, I now bless her from the bottom of my heart; if I
hated her before, I now love her: tell her this, and tell her,
moreover, not to abhor her father, believing that he is cruel
towards the poor captives, for he only is so because the creed
of the nation over which he reigns, and the desire to preserve
a crown for his son, compel him to act thus. A maiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
reared in the shadow of a throne must suffer much and run
grave risks in a desert in a foreign land, amid pain and
poverty. Act as a father to Casilda, protect and watch over her,
and I swear that I shall act in a similar way to your children,
should fate bring them some day into the dominions of&mdash;<span class="smcap">Almenon</span>."</p>

<p>Sobs almost smothered Casilda when she finished the reading
of the letter; but her heart rejoiced because her father still
loved her, still blessed her, and no longer wept on her account.</p>

<p>"Casilda," said Don Fernando to her, "it is not in vain that
your father appeals to my heart to satisfy the desires of his.
From this day forward you shall have a father in me; and as
it is your ambition to possess means wherewith to aid misfortune,
my treasury is open to you&mdash;avail yourself of it, and
let no one, who is really in want, apply in vain at your door."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some days after the visit of the king to the solitaries of the
lake, Ximena entered Burgos, accompanied by a brilliant
escort of cavaliers, belonging to the court of Don Fernando,
who had himself come to meet her, riding a considerable
distance on the road of Briviesca.</p>

<p>Some peasants, who were journeying at the same time to
the city, stopped to gaze on the young girl and her richly-dressed
companions, and as they were ignorant of the news of
the court, on account of the distance they lived from it, and
did not know Ximena, one of them went up to a workman who
was standing at the door of a house, and asked him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know who that splendid girl is? On my soul,
she looks like a queen."</p>

<p>"What? you don't know her? She is Doña Ximena,
daughter of the Count of Gormaz, who is going to be married
to the son of the grandee of Vivar," replied the man who had
been questioned.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Is it not said that the youth killed the
count?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And he is going to be married to the daughter of the dead
man! Well, queer things happen now-a-days. One must be
badly off for a husband."</p>

<p>"Be silent, you bumpkin, and don't speak badly of a lady
who is more honourable than you and your whole clan."</p>

<p>"Keep quiet yourself, you Burgos ruffian, for I swear I have
fists, and won't listen to insults."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"And do you imagine, you clown, that I haven't got fists
also? I swear I'll break every bone in your body."</p>

<p>Saying this, the workman rushed on the peasant; the
spectators, however, got between them, and the man of Burgos
had to return to his post when only a few blows had been
exchanged.</p>

<p>"Do the rustics imagine that the townspeople are made of
sugar paste?" he said.</p>

<p>"And why do the townspeople insult us?"</p>

<p>"Why do you judge of things without understanding them?"</p>

<p>"Explain them, and I'll understand them."</p>

<p>"Then know that Doña Ximena, instead of being found
fault with, should be pitied, for they are marrying her to Don
Rodrigo much against her wish. She certainly was in love
with him one time, but she took a dislike to him when he
killed her father, and if she now marries him, it is in obedience
to the command of the king, who so arranges matters, for he
considers that the union of the houses of Vivar and of Gormaz
will prevent the formation of bodies of partisans who would
flood the kingdom with blood, and he says that public good
must be thought more of than private sentiment."</p>

<p>"And the king is right."</p>

<p>"Of course he is; and the more so, because Don Rodrigo
did not kill the father of Doña Ximena unfairly. Yes! Don
Fernando knows well what he is about, and does not fear
being accused of doing wrong. I hold, for my part, that there's
not a better king in the world."</p>

<p>"Do you know that the maiden is worth half Castile?"</p>

<p>"And the young cavalier knows it, too, and he is certainly
worthy of her."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW RODRIGO AND XIMENA WERE MARRIED, AND HOW THE
DEVIL TERRIFIED THE PEOPLE OF BURGOS</p></blockquote>


<p>The month of September was commencing, and it was the
early morning of a Sunday, calm and mild as a day in spring,
for the burning heats of summer had ceased, and were replaced
by the cool breezes which autumn brings with it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
especially in the country about Burgos. There might have
been noticed in that city an unusual animation, and a
multitude of people were flocking towards it from the districts
all around; but where that throng and bustle was most perceptible
was in the immediate neighbourhood of the church of
Santa Gadea.</p>

<p>The reader will already have surmised what the circumstance
was which in this manner was disturbing the habitual
tranquillity of the capital of Castile and its suburbs; on that
day were to be celebrated the nuptials of Rodrigo Diaz and
Ximena Gome, and the king and queen were to give away the
bridegroom and the bride. In the streets which led from the
Alcazar to the church, all the balconies and windows were
magnificently adorned with flowers and rich hangings; the
ground was strewn with flowers and sweet-smelling herbs, and
at intervals beautiful arches, covered with foliage, had been
erected. These nuptials were the cause of great satisfaction,
not alone to the relations and friends of the bride and bridegroom,
but also to the good people of Castile, who now felt
sure that there would no longer be any danger of feuds and
bloodshed. For these reasons the citizens had done their
utmost to adorn and make gay the streets through which the
bridal procession was to pass.</p>

<p>The sun had not long risen, when the crowds which peopled
the streets began to move and direct their eyes towards the
Alcazar, for the chiming of the bells of Santa Gadea was
announcing that the wedding party had issued from its gate;
for, it may be mentioned, Don Fernando, desirous of doing
honour to Rodrigo and Ximena in every possible way, had
lodged them in his palace. A few moments afterwards the
brilliant cortège was in full view of the expectant multitude.</p>

<p>How beautiful was Ximena, and how high-spirited
Rodrigo! They walked between the king and queen, and
near them were Diego Lainez and Teresa Nuña, on whose
countenances beamed joy and parental pride. There accompanied
them also many of their relations, and the most distinguished
dames and cavaliers of the court. The crowds
pressed on to gaze at them, and the king's guards found some
difficulty in keeping the way clear for the procession. At last
they arrived at the church, where the bishop, Don Ximeno,
awaited them, and then the multitudes began again by rough
shoving and pushing to endeavour to secure the best positions
for seeing them when they returned after the sacred ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>The agitation and disorder which for a considerable time
had reigned in the crowd, packed tightly together opposite the
church of Santa Gadea, gradually ceased, and all were peacefully
expressing their opinions on the richness of the dresses, on the
beauty of the bride, on the brave appearance of the bridegroom,
and on the circumstances which had preceded these
famous nuptials.</p>

<p>"As God lives, that Ximena is of more value than all her
estates, and they are so large that the Moors could make four
kingdoms out of them, each of the size of those which they
rule over," said a youth who seemed to be a page by his dress,
and who, with two companions, was mounted on the railings
which protected the porch of Santa Gadea.</p>

<p>"Rodrigo and his estates at Vivar are worth just as much,"
replied another of the youths.</p>

<p>"And I tell you," added the third, "that Rodrigo Diaz will
soon be the ruler of an empire. Have you not heard of the
gifts which Don Fernando has given to the bride and bridegroom?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing of them, for my lord and master, the
Count of Carrion, hates the family of Vivar so much, that
nobody dares to mention their names in his castle."</p>

<p>"Then you must know that he has given to them, and to
their heirs for ever, the seigniories of Valduerna, of Belorado,
and of Saldaña."</p>

<p>"By the saints, how generous Don Fernando must be!"</p>

<p>"The king knows right well what he is doing, for he should
be generous to him who won Calahorra for him, which he had
lost if the knight of Vivar were not as valiant as he is. And
for my part, I believe that Don Rodrigo will win for Castile,
from the Moors, more castles than there are houses on the
estates which Don Fernando has given to him."</p>

<p>"And it is certain that Don Rodrigo is valiant. My
master could tell a good deal about that, and the son of my
mother also, if the people round us were not making such a
noise."</p>

<p>"I'd like to hear all about it, Guillen."</p>

<p>"And I also."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have to be satisfied with the desire of hearing
it, for this is not the place to relate adventures in which my
lord came off very badly."</p>

<p>This refusal of Guillen, as may be supposed, whetted the
curiosity of his companions, who, one on each side of him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
edged themselves on, along the bar on which they sat, until
they were in contact with him.</p>

<p>"Relate the adventure to us, Guillen, for I bet it is worth
hearing," said one of his friends.</p>

<p>"I shall tell it, just to please you; but if Don Suero, my
master, knew that I related this adventure, I should soon be
in a condition to relate no more of them, but like my companions,
the other servants of the count, who remained at the
Inn of the Moor with holes in their hearts, made by the lance
of that terrible squire of Don Rodrigo, named Fernan."</p>

<p>"Cease your nonsense, friend Guillen, and go on with your
story."</p>

<p>"I shall do so at once."</p>

<p>And Guillen related to his friends the carrying off of Beatrice,
almost exactly as the reader already knows it.</p>

<p>"And is it possible that the Count of Carrion commits such
outrages?" asked one of the listeners.</p>

<p>"Very little surprises you, my friend," replied Guillen, still
in a low voice, and looking about cautiously to see if he could
be overheard by any of those who were standing about, waiting
to see the wedding party come forth from the church. "Your
astonishment would be greater," he continued, "if you only
knew the circumstances of the carrying off of another girl by
Don Suero, some time before his attempt on Beatrice."</p>

<p>Illan and Garcia, for such were the names of the other
pages, squeezed themselves more closely, if such were possible,
against Guillen, bending their necks and bringing their ears
close to his mouth. Seeing, however, that the servant of Don
Suero did not satisfy their curiosity with the promptitude they
desired, they abandoned gestures in order to question him
with words.</p>

<p>"And how did this other outrage take place?" asked Illan,
who was the more curious of the two.</p>

<p>"It happened as you will soon hear, if those who related it
to me were not liars, for at that time I was not in the service
of Don Suero. There was in the neighbourhood of Carrion a
maiden&mdash;a peasant girl, indeed, but one of the handsomest
that could be found in Castile or Leon. Don Suero thought
little of taking her from her father, as he was smitten by her
beauty; and, using cunning devices, he succeeded in inducing
both father and daughter to go to the castle of Carrion, and
there he dishonoured the girl, and deprived the father of his
sight, so that he might not be able to find his daughter, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
take vengeance on him for what he had done. The girl, who
was good and modest, resisted his wooing for a long time, but
the count had recourse to violence, and Sancha, for such was
the name of his victim, had to yield at last to the brutality of
her jailer. Days and months went on, and Don Suero, who
was much in love with the peasant girl, redoubled his caresses,
hoping to make her love him also. The girl was becoming, by
degrees, more yielding as time went on, softened by the
tenderness and by the gifts of Don Suero. But behold! an
old gipsy woman entered her apartment one day. This old
woman was in the habit of telling fortunes, and the count put
up with this, and with other queer things which she did. She
and the girl, however, disappeared from the castle, some say
by witchcraft, for they thought it could not be by any other
means, and it was well known that the old gipsy was an expert
in the black art, like all the rest of her race. It is easy for you
to imagine the despair and the rage of the count when he was
informed of the flight of Sancha. It is only necessary to say
that, in order to give vent to his anger, he nearly killed all his
servants and vassals with beatings, and, hoping to forget the
girl, he established in his castle a kind of harem, to which he
carries off the handsomest girls of the country, when he gets a
chance of doing so."</p>

<p>"And have they never learned the abode of the unfortunate
Sancha?"</p>

<p>"No; all the efforts which Don Suero has used to find her
out have been in vain."</p>

<p>"And those of her father to discover her?"</p>

<p>"Have been also unavailing."</p>

<p>"What has become of him?"</p>

<p>"He seeks his daughter in every direction; but the unhappy
man cannot find her. He goes from town to town, weeping
over his loss, and earns something to live on by playing a lute."</p>

<p>"Anger of God! and are you not ashamed to remain in the
service of such a wicked master?"</p>

<p>"I am ashamed, in truth, but you must know that I cannot
go away from his residence; for if I lived far from the castle
of Carrion, I should die of grief."</p>

<p>"By the glorious St. Isidore, I do not understand you!"
exclaimed Illan.</p>

<p>"Guillen, you want to bewilder us with your mysteries,"
added Garcia. "Are there not plenty of masters who would
be only too glad to get a respectable page or squire?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Leave that wretch of a Don Suero immediately, for my
master, the Count of Cabra, wants at present an honourable
and brave page like you, and he would engage you at once."</p>

<p>"I tell you that I cannot leave the service of the Count of
Carrion."</p>

<p>"If the count were a lady, I should say you were in love
with him."</p>

<p>"Then learn that I am in love, and very much in love, my
friends."</p>

<p>Illan and Garcia broke into a loud laugh, caused not so
much by the words of Guillen, as by the sentimental tone in
which he pronounced them.</p>

<p>"By the saints! if you laugh at me, I will spit you on the
points of these bars!" exclaimed Guillen, made angry by the
laughter of his friends, which had caused the people standing
about to fix their attention on them.</p>

<p>Illan and Garcia felt that Guillen had just cause for his
annoyance, and ceased laughing.</p>

<p>"Don't be vexed, Guillen," said the former, "but explain
yourself to us."</p>

<p>"I tell you that I am in love, and by confiding to you this
secret, for no one else must know it, I am proving to both of
you the warmth of my friendship."</p>

<p>"But who are you in love with?"</p>

<p>Guillen looked around on all sides, and then replied in a
very low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"With Doña Teresa, my mistress."</p>

<p>Illan and Garcia found some difficulty to restrain themselves
from again bursting out into laughter. However, they checked
themselves when they noticed the angry gesture of Guillen
when he saw the fresh symptoms of hilarity.</p>

<p>"With Doña Teresa! with the sister of the count your
master!" exclaimed Illan. "Are you mad, Guillen, or are
you making fun of us?"</p>

<p>"I am not making fun of you; but I am mad&mdash;mad in love,
my friends."</p>

<p>"But is it returned?"</p>

<p>"How could it be, when I have never dared to declare my
love to her who is the object of it?"</p>

<p>"But don't you know, you fool, that if the noble Doña
Teresa, the sister of the Count of Carrion, happened to discover
that you were in love with her, she would laugh at you,
if indeed she did not get you driven with blows from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
castle. Don't you know that if Don Suero learned it, he would
get you flayed alive?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing, my friends,&mdash;I know nothing but that I
love her with all my heart and soul."</p>

<p>"But what right has a poor page to love so great a lady?"</p>

<p>"It is easy to know, my friends that you are as low-minded
and ignorant as the bulk of pages. Tell me, however, is not
a lady a woman, no matter how rich and noble she may happen
to be?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"And is not a page a man, no matter how poor and
obscure he may be?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, likewise."</p>

<p>"Then, is it extraordinary that a man should love a woman,
and a woman a man?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then, you simpletons, don't be astonished that I, a
poor and obscure page, love my lady Doña Teresa, and that
she, rich and noble as she is, may love me some day or other."</p>

<p>"You argue, friend Guillen, as well as if you had attended
lectures in the School of Palencia; but I am quite certain that
neither your lady nor the count would see it in the same light
as you."</p>

<p>"If my mistress were like the ordinary run of women,
or even like the generality of men, who think only as others
think, and not as they themselves should think, my love would
be certainly great folly; but I know well that Doña Teresa is
guided more by reason than by custom. Besides, who has
told you, ignoble as you are, that I may not be rich and noble
some day, if Doña Teresa desires that he who is to obtain her
hand and heart should be so? I am young, and, 'fore God, I
am not wanting in courage. Only let the Moors get up a war
on the frontiers, and you will see how I can wield a lance,
and perchance return to Carrion as much a cavalier as the
count my master. You will see how, once dubbed a knight,
I shall collect together a hundred or so brave fellows, enter
the country of the Moors, and conquer it. Then I shall
become a lord over vassals, for, on my faith, it will not be the
first time that such things have happened. You can't imagine,
my friend, how my love for Doña Teresa increases when I
think over those chances."</p>

<p>"I hope in goodness that your love won't bring you to
perdition!" said Garcia in a prophetic tone of voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is to glory that it shall lead me," replied Guillen
enthusiastically. "This love which I feel, impossible as it
may seem to you, will exalt the humble page whom you see
here. The greater the prize is, for which the wrestler struggles,
so much the more bravely does he brace himself up for the
contest. Do you imagine that Rodrigo Diaz could have
fought so well if, in addition to conquering Martin Gonzalez,
he had not hoped for the embraces of Ximena?"</p>

<p>Illan and Garcia could not but feel that amid the wild fancies
of Guillen there might be well founded hopes. For that
reason they thought it best to leave him in the paradise of his
illusions. Just as in our times he who believes in nothing,
he who considers but vain words the faith of his ancestors,
the love of country, the love for a woman, is the man who
most probably will raise himself over others, so, in the times
when Guillen lived, that man had the best chance of elevating
himself who believed in all those things, and, exalted by such
sentiments, acted in accordance with his beliefs. Oh for
that age, when, in order to be honoured, the cavalier had
to consecrate his heart to God, to a king, and to a woman,&mdash;three
sovereigns, who had their thrones respectively in heaven,
on earth, and at the domestic hearth, and all of them in the
soul of a man. If amongst those who at the present day bear
the name of cavalier, there are any who do not wish to bear it
in vain, they must be cautious with regard to acknowledging
that they adore God, that they would die for the anointed of
the Lord, or that they love or are faithful to a woman; for
they would be laughed at and looked on as madmen, and
in vain would they argue that the idols are false and loathsome
which have usurped the altars on which these three divinities
were formerly enthroned.</p>

<p>Our three youths had arrived at that point in their conversation
at which we left them, in order to heave a sigh over
lost beliefs, which it would be very difficult to replace. The
bells of Santa Gadea announced, with a loud peal, that religion
had sanctified the union of the noble scions of the trees
of Vivar and of Gormaz. The crowds began to move, to
crush, to squeeze, if we may so express ourselves, and with
the sounds of the bells were mingled cries of pain, angry
exclamations, threats, supplications, weeping, curses,&mdash;all that
Babel of sounds which is usually heard amongst a great
multitude, when it is compressed into a space which cannot
well contain much more than half its numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"The women ought to be at home spinning!"</p>

<p>"The men should be killing the Moors!"</p>

<p>"Your eyes are killing Christians, Moorish women!"</p>

<p>"Hi, hi, hi! Don't be tickling me, dueña!"</p>

<p>"Is my face rosy, you bumpkin?"</p>

<p>"It smells of roses, by my faith!"</p>

<p>"Who is the jade that's crushing me?"</p>

<p>"I swear it's an old witch; has she come here to cast the
evil eye on the bride and bridegroom?"</p>

<p>"You brute, you are crushing in my breast with your
elbows."</p>

<p>"A thousand legions of demons! my pocket-handkerchief
has been stolen."</p>

<p>"Oh, my silk petticoat is falling off!"</p>

<p>"Confound those court festivals."</p>

<p>"And also that Don Rodrigo and Doña Ximena."</p>

<p>"I swear I'll cut out your tongue if you say a word against
them."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, ay!"</p>

<p>"May the devil take the women!"</p>

<p>"<i>I am coming for them, I am coming for them!</i>"</p>

<p>This whirlwind of exclamations, which are only faint
samples of the hundred thousand which were heard every
minute, changed its character, when the one which we have
emphasised was heard.</p>

<p>"I am coming for them, I am coming for them!" repeated a
rough and terror-striking voice, which seemed to issue from a
dilapidated house, just beside the church of Santa Gadea, and
which, even before it had begun to fall into ruins, was uninhabited
for a long time; for it was said that whenever the devil
came to carry off an inhabitant of Burgos, he took lodgings
in it, for two reasons: firstly, that he might not have to pass
the night in the open air, as Burgos is rather cool and the
devil is accustomed to a warm climate; and secondly, to
terrify, with the infernal glitter of his eyes, the pious people
who were accustomed to pray at night-time before a holy
statue, which stood at the gate of the adjoining church, and
which was much venerated.</p>

<p>Loud cries of terror arose from the multitude; the children
took refuge under the petticoats of the women, like chickens
beneath the wings of a hen, and the women clung to the men,
as ivy does to the oak. A minute had scarcely passed, when a
terrible-looking figure emerged from the ruined house, a figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
which made even some of the boldest tremble. It was the
devil, without doubt, if appearances could be trusted. It was
clad in a flame-coloured suit; it had a tail which moved from
side to side like a whip; its forehead was furnished with two
enormous horns, and through its large mouth smoke was issuing
as from a chimney.</p>

<p>"I am coming for them, I am coming for them!" he
roared again, as he came out of his hiding place, and rushed
towards the crowd.</p>

<p>"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!" was exclaimed in all directions.
Not seeing, however, that the devil was stopped by the holy
invocation, everybody took to flight in the wildest disorder.
The children came forth from their hiding-places under the
petticoats, and in a few moments all the streets around the
church of Santa Gadea were empty, for even the men did
not wait for the devil, although he had declared that he only
came for the women.</p>

<p>We have said that no one remained in the immediate
neighbourhood of the church, but we have not been strictly
accurate. Illan and Garcia jumped down from the railing
as soon as the devil appeared, and fled like all the rest; but
Guillen thought that he who was not afraid of the Count of
Carrion need not be afraid of the devil, and he awaited him
without moving from his position.</p>

<p>"Sir Devil," he said to him, seeing that he came in his
direction, "leave me in peace if you desire to have a good
friend in Carrion, should you ever go there."</p>

<p>The devil looked round in all directions, and, seeing that
no person observed them, he pulled off his horns and his tail,
which he had been able to set in motion by a simple contrivance,
and took off a mask, under which was burning tow, from
which proceeded the smoke that had issued from the mouth.</p>

<p>"Pelayo!" exclaimed Guillen, on seeing the face of the
supposed devil; "what foolishness has put such a ridiculous
notion into your head?"</p>

<p>"On my soul," replied Pelayo, "I see no foolishness in
clearing the road for the king and the wedding procession.
If I had not done so, twenty heads at least would be broken
during its return by the maces of the royal guards, to judge
by what I saw at its going. And look," he continued, pointing
to the vestibule of the church, "the cortège is just coming
out; you will see how quietly and comfortably it will get to
the Alcazar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom, with their companions, were
indeed just issuing from the church. They proceeded along
the road to the Alcazar, the mace-bearers not having to clear
a way for them, as the spectators had ascended to the windows
and balconies, and even to the roofs of the houses, leaving
the streets almost empty.</p>

<p>On their arrival at the Alcazar, everyone inquired what
was the cause of this unusual condition of things, and, as
can be proved with certainty, Don Fernando called aside
Pelayo, who was one of his servants, and, according to tradition,
gave him sixteen maravedis, on account of his strange
enterprise, which was much spoken of and laughed over
during the banquet which the king gave in honour of the
newly-married couple.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW RODRIGO BECAME THE POSSESSOR OF BABIECA, AND
WHAT HAPPENED WHILST HE WAS RIDING HIM</p></blockquote>


<p>There is a place in Burgos known by the name of the "Solar<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
del Cid," and an inscription placed on it by the municipality
of the city shows that the famous cavalier, Rodrigo Diaz de
Vivar, was born there.</p>

<p>One of the ancestors of Diego Lainez, appointed governor
of the district of Castile, and obliged to fix his residence in
its chief city, had erected an unpretentious house in Burgos,
and his descendants preserved it and resided in it when their
duties at the Court obliged them to leave their ancestral home
at Vivar. Diego Lainez and his wife Teresa were residing
in it when Rodrigo came into the world, and quitted it shortly
afterwards, in order to make Vivar their permanent abode.
Now, however, as Don Fernando had changed the court to
Burgos, and as Diego was charged with the duty of watching
over the education of the princes, that old house, deserted
for so many years, was again inhabited by its noble owners.
They had entered it only a few days before the wedding of
Rodrigo.</p>

<p>Here are reunited all those whom we have seen in the castle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>of Vivar, and even some more. Here are Rodrigo, Ximena,
Diego, Teresa, the good Lambra, Mayor, Fernan, and Alvar;
all contented, all happy, contemplating the felicity of the two
first mentioned. Already were being realised the beautiful
dreams of Rodrigo and Ximena; already were being brought
to their fulfilment those golden hopes, so often combated
and opposed, so often dead and brought to life again! What
will Rodrigo now do? Will he consecrate his life exclusively
to love, to Ximena, to the pleasures of the domestic hearth,
and to the luxuries which his wealth can procure for him?
No, a hundred times no! Noble souls, generous hearts,
are never without honourable aspirations. Rodrigo, the noble
descendant of the Judges of Castile, of so many excellent
men, who had consecrated their lives to the glory of their
God and of their country, will not wear away his life devoted
to the effeminate pleasures of love and wealth. He feels that
man has come into the world for something more than to
pass through it like a shadow which leaves no trace behind
it; he knows well that the most just and most honourable
nation and the holiest religion have implacable enemies,
and require generous souls and brave hearts to come to their
defence; he knows that in Spain, as in all other places, there
are weak who require the aid of the strong, that there are
oppressors and oppressed. The contest which he had fought
with his heart being ended, he is about to sustain with his
arm another, not less difficult and arduous, certain that victory
would crown it, as it did the former. The sons of Mahomet
raise their impious standard at the frontiers of Castile and
Leon, and frequently invade the dominions of the king, Don
Fernando. To fight against them and conquer them is now
the ambition of Rodrigo. What strength will not the thought
of his Ximena lend to his arm, feeling that the aureole of his
triumphs will also shine around her head; certain that on his
return to Burgos she will receive him with open arms, and
with love in her heart, in her eyes, and on her lips,&mdash;that
beautiful woman of whom he had dreamed during so many
years, with whom he had shared the joys and sports of childhood,
and the hopes and illusions of youth! What joy will
it not be for him to pass from the arms of his wife to those
of his old and honoured father, and then to those of his
beloved mother! What recompense will it not be for his
prowess when he will see his parents and wife weep with joy,
tremble with pride; and hear them bless him, and bless God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
for having rewarded their love and their sufferings by giving
so good a son, so good a husband! Mean and vulgar souls
consider as worthless such triumphs, such joys, such raptures,
rich with holiness and with poetry; but souls like those of
Rodrigo know their full value. Happy art thou, Ximena,
having such a husband. How many maidens are there in
this fair Castile who look on thy triumph with envy, who
look angrily on thee for having taken from them the youth
of their dreams, the youth with the honourable soul, the
loving and ardent heart, the handsome and valiant mien,
of whom they had dreamed a thousand times, whilst the
guardian angel of maidens watched beside their beds under
the appearance of a mother.</p>

<p>It was an autumn morning, beautiful, peaceful, mild; the
sky was blue, and the birds were singing, as if mistaking the
season for springtime. Rodrigo impressed a sweet kiss on
the lips of Ximena, received a sweeter one from her in return,
and went forth from his paradise, accompanied by his good
squire Fernan. They issued from Burgos on foot, and, walking
along the bank of the Arlanzon, they proceeded in the
up-stream direction, not as master and servant, but as two
good friends. The meadows which they passed were very
beautiful, but they had never before appeared so fair to
Rodrigo, for love and happiness are prisms, which make all
things appear as if clothed in brilliant hues. Whither were
Rodrigo and his squire going on foot, and at so early an hour?
Let us listen to them.</p>

<p>"Sir," says Fernan, "for a journey on foot we are going
rather far from Burgos, and my lady Ximena will be very
uneasy before we return, as we shall have to spend half a day
in a walk which she thinks will only take an hour. Besides,
sir, as you are not used to walking, you will be very much
fatigued."</p>

<p>The reader will remember what we said on another
occasion, namely, that the slyness of the squire caused him
to attribute to others his own weaknesses. These traces of
hypocrisy must, however, be forgiven him, on account of the
sincerity which, in other respects, characterised him. The
fact of the matter is, that, having made his peace with Mayorica,
in honour of the marriage of his master, as farther on we shall
learn in more detail, it was the maid of Doña Teresa who
likely would be uneasy, for he had told her that he would be
back within an hour, as, going on foot, he believed they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
only about to take a short walk, not far beyond the fortifications
of the city. For that reason Fernan had also postponed
his breakfast until his return. With regard to fatigue, he
was likewise thinking of himself, as he also was not much
accustomed to walking, and, being rather stout, would feel it
much more than his master.</p>

<p>"Indeed," replied Rodrigo, with joyous familiarity, "the
beauty of the fields and thoughts on our approaching
adventures amongst the Moors have occupied my mind so
much, that I forgot to tell you where we are going. You
know already that, amongst the wedding gifts, my godfather
Don Peyre presented me with two horses, and he left it to
myself to take from his stables, which contain many, those
which might please me most. Well, then, we are now going to
select them&mdash;one for me and the other for you."</p>

<p>"But, sir, you have been so generous to me at your
marriage"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish you to have this souvenir of it also. The steed on
which I was mounted when I fought against Martin Gonzalez
was handsome and high-spirited, but I would never ride again,
if I could avoid it, so weak an animal. I shall never again
trust to a horse by his appearance, as you shall see when we
are in the stables of Don Peyre."</p>

<p>Master and squire continued conversing on this and other
subjects until they arrived near a village, in which arose a
tower with ramparts, and near it a low building, which, from
its appearance, must be the stable of which they were in
search.</p>

<p>Rodrigo and Fernan entered the tower, the occupant of
which was Don Peyre Pringos, and in a short time they came
forth again with him and proceeded towards the stables, much
against the will of Fernan, who, in order to accompany them,
had to leave an excellent breakfast, which on a slight hint
from him had been served up in the kitchen of Don Peyre.</p>

<p>The stables were divided into two compartments, one fitted
up for the horses and the other as a harness-room.</p>

<p>"Godson," said Don Peyre, "stand near the stable door,
and, according as the horses are driven out, select those which
most please you."</p>

<p>"Fernan," said in his turn Rodrigo, "place yourself at the
other side of the door, and choose whichever horse you
like best."</p>

<p>"I shall do so with very great pleasure," replied Fernan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
who was exceedingly well contented, notwithstanding the
slight annoyance he felt at having to leave the succulent
breakfast that had been prepared for him; for he saw in the
stables sufficient horses from which to choose not alone two,
but even two dozen.</p>

<p>The stable-boy then began to drive the animals out, and
they came on through the harness-room. Fernan placed his
hand on a white-and-red spotted horse, very high and of
handsome appearance, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you don't take him for yourself, sir, this one shall
be mine."</p>

<p>"'Fore God," exclaimed Don Peyre, "the squire is not a fool!"</p>

<p>"Some day you will know, as Agrajes said,"<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> replied Rodrigo,
"that such horses are good for riding on festive occasions, but
for war I desire another kind, as you shall now see;" and as a
horse, black, slender, not very tall, and almost as gentle-looking
as an ass, came forth, he touched him with his hand
and said, according to the "Chronicle of the Cid"&mdash;</p>

<p>"This one do I like."</p>

<p>"<i>Babieca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_7" id="FNanchor_2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_7" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> you have badly chosen," said Don Peyre.</p>

<p>"This shall be my horse," replied Rodrigo, "and his name
shall be Babieca. Have you not called me <i>babieca</i>? My
horse must be so called also, in order that both you and I
may remember this difference of opinion. I feel quite sure,
godfather Don Peyre, that it is you who shall have to change
your mind regarding battlehorses, and not I, should I be in
a fight with him."</p>

<p>"I say to you, godson, as you remarked recently to your
squire, 'you will know some day, as Agrajes said,'" replied
Don Peyre. He then ordered the stablemen to caparison the
two horses with handsome accoutrements.</p>

<p>Shortly after, Rodrigo and Fernan started on their return to
Burgos; the latter was particularly well pleased with the
fine-looking speckled horse which he bestrode, and which
attracted much attention on the part of those they met on the
road.</p>

<p>Having entered the city, and as they were passing the
mansion of the Count of Carrion, they saw at its door a
number of squires, pages, and other servitors of the count,
who were holding harnessed horses by the bridles, and were
apparently ready to set out at once. Guillen, who has already
been introduced to the reader, was amongst them. Certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>the steed of Rodrigo, which in future we shall call by the
name of Babieca, as such had been given to him by his master,
might be fairly considered a subject for the jokes of the wits
and loiterers in the streets. However, Rodrigo was so
respected and feared in Burgos, that no person had the
temerity to laugh at his steed, until he arrived at the place
where the house of Don Suero stood. When he and Fernan
had got thus far, the servants of the count began to make
observations to each other, and to laugh loudly, to which at
first the newly-arrived paid no attention; but soon they were
obliged to notice their insolence.</p>

<p>"Honoured squire," said one of them, addressing Fernan,
"could you tell us whether the steed of this cavalier, your
master, belongs to the horse or to the ass species?"</p>

<p>"It is a horse," replied Fernan, with difficulty restraining
his anger, "for if it were an ass, you certainly would recognise
your brother?"</p>

<p>"Then, brother, I thank you for your courtesy."</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub, I shall mark the face of Don
Bellaco!"<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> exclaimed Fernan, directing his horse towards the
insolent fellow, and striking him across the face with the reins.</p>

<p>All the servants of Don Suero uttered a cry of indignation,
and were making ready to rush on the unarmed squire of
Rodrigo, although Guillen did his best to pacify them, trying
to prove to them that it was they who were in the wrong.
When Rodrigo, who had proceeded some distance onwards,
heard the uproar, he turned round, and, seeing what was taking
place, he turned back and hastened, with dagger in hand,
to defend his squire.</p>

<p>"Remain where you are, sir," cried Fernan, "for I am well
able by myself to chastise these fellows, who have dared to
make fun of your horse."</p>

<p>It almost seemed as if Babieca understood what Fernan
said, that is, that they had been speaking disrespectfully of him,
for, without his master having to touch him with the spurs, he
rushed upon the servants of the count, whom Rodrigo dispersed
in a moment, although, not having any weapon but his
dagger, he inflicted no wounds on them.</p>

<p>On hearing the noise of the quarrel, Don Suero came to a
window and cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is the coward that is trampling down my servants?"</p>

<p>"A cavalier who will forfeit the name of such if he does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>prove to you this very day that it is you who are the coward,"
retorted Rodrigo, turning angrily towards Don Suero.</p>

<p>The count trembled on seeing that he whom he had insulted
was Rodrigo, the brave youth whose sword had left
indelible marks on his throat at the Inn of the Moor; but as
he was out of reach of his dagger, and in the presence of his
servants, he made a great effort to overcome his fear, and
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"My sword, as God lives, shall prove to you that you are
an ill-born clown!"</p>

<p>"Then give me but time to fetch my sword, treacherous
count, and prepare yourself for the combat in the meantime,
which shall take place on this very spot, where you can await
me, as I shall be back immediately."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Rodrigo set spurs to Babieca, and rode on
to his residence, followed by Fernan. Having arrived there,
he put on his coat of mail, girt on his sword, and took his
lance and shield. The squire also got his heavy lance, and
both of them, again mounting their horses, returned to the
mansion of the count. The door and the street before
it were now, however, deserted; Rodrigo approached the
former and gave a heavy knock on it with the butt-end of his
lance, but as no one answered, he cried out, in a loud and
angry voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come forward, calumnious and insolent count, and abductor
of women!"</p>

<p>"Sir knight," called out a woman from an upper window of
an adjacent house, "according to the description you give, it
must be the Count of Carrion you are seeking."</p>

<p>"The very same, honoured dueña," replied Rodrigo.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir knight, would to God I had never set foot in
Burgos, and my eyes would not be now two rivers of tears!
Hi, hi, hi!"</p>

<p>"Can you not tell me, woman, if"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir knight, I am just going to do so; but you
must know that I had a daughter, more beautiful than a May
morning&mdash;Hi, hi, hi!&mdash;Daughter of my heart!"</p>

<p>"Anger of God, stop your weeping!" exclaimed Rodrigo,
impatient to procure information regarding the count.</p>

<p>"Why should I not weep, sir?" continued the old woman,
with a calmness sufficient to deprive Job himself of patience.
"Why should I not weep, when that accursed count has stolen
my daughter! Hi, hi, hi! Woe is me, I must now die of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
hunger, when I have no one to earn anything to keep me
alive."</p>

<p>Rodrigo had let his impatience and annoyance give way to
compassion, and was about to alleviate the affliction of the old
woman. Fernan, however, whose heart was not so susceptible to
the misfortunes of others, now interfered, exclaiming angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Judas Iscariot! if I were up there, I'd soon make that
old chatterbox hold her tongue."</p>

<p>Her weeping and the excitement of her mind prevented her,
doubtless, from noticing that it was the squire who had spoken,
for she continued, as if it were Rodrigo himself who had addressed
her so roughly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, sir knight, I am a respectable dueña, as you first
named me, and now you call me a chatterbox! Hi, hi, hi!
That is too bad, when I have lost my daughter, who was the
best girl in the world! Ah, woe is me! What will become
of me without my Aldonza!"</p>

<p>"Aldonza!" exclaimed Fernan, giving such a start that he
nearly fell from his saddle, and then added, turning to his
master&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub, sir, this old procuress is making
fun of us to her heart's content! The jade that she says has
been stolen from her by the count, is not a bit better than
herself."</p>

<p>Rodrigo, whose patience had been almost exhausted by the
talkativeness and lamentations of the old woman, lost it entirely
when he heard what his squire said, and cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let there be an end of this nonsense, whether you are respectable
or not! Where is the count?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if it's that, sir knight&mdash;A short time before you
knocked at the door, he and all his attendants rode off very
rapidly."</p>

<p>"Confound both him and you, old witch, who have delayed
us here for half an hour!" cried Rodrigo, driving the spurs into
the flanks of poor Babieca. "Let us follow him, even should
it be as far as Carrion!"</p>

<p>Babieca and Overo, the speckled horse, started as quick as
lightning on the road that led to Carrion.</p>

<p>"I promise that I will prove to him that he is a coward,"
said Rodrigo; "and even should he hide himself in his castle,
my lance shall there find his breast. Fly, fly, my good Babieca,
for thou also art interested in my vengeance!"</p>

<p>But at a short distance from Burgos, Rodrigo and his squire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
distinguished, in a south-easterly direction, a dense column of
smoke ascending towards the sky, and in succession farther
on they saw another in the same direction.</p>

<p>They were the smoke signals which were lit on the watch-towers,
in order to give warning whenever the Moors crossed
the frontiers.</p>

<p>"The Moors have crossed the Moncayo!" exclaimed Rodrigo.
"Before avenging injuries done to myself, I must avenge
those against God, the king, and my country. Fernan, let us
return to Burgos."</p>

<p>"Yes, let us return," replied Fernan, "and make preparations
for an expedition against the Moorish power. As God lives,
my heart is almost bursting my breast with joy. It is a long
time now, my beloved lance, since thy temper was restored by
the blood of those Moslem dogs. Ah, and what splendid
thrusts thou wilt give! And you, sir, will have splendid spoils
to lay at the feet of my lady Doña Ximena!"</p>

<p>"Fernan," cried Rodrigo, with enthusiasm, "I must have a
throne, that Ximena may sit on it! I must have Moorish
queens to wait on her!"</p>

<p>And, guiding Babieca close to his squire's horse, he held
forth his hand to Fernan, and said warmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fernan, this hand which clasps yours, and the heart
which I feel beating in my breast, shall win a throne and
subjugate Moorish queens!"</p>

<p>Fernan, on hearing the words of his master, and on receiving
the pressure of his hand, felt a tear trickle down his
rough and sunburned cheek.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW RODRIGO ROUSED UP THE COUNTRY, AND DEFEATED
THE MOORS IN THE MOUNTAINS OF OCA</p></blockquote>


<p>"Up, up, cavaliers of Castile! cover yourselves with your
steel coats of mail, buckle on the golden spurs, bind on the
sword, grasp the knee and the shield, and mount your fiery
chargers, which neigh and paw in their stables, impatient to
career over the wide plains. Fly over them, and close with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the Moors, until your battlehorses trample down the Moslem
standard, and the impious Crescent is made a pedestal for the
Cross!</p>

<p>"Up, up, cavaliers of Castile! Five Moorish kings have
crossed the Moncayo, and overrun with a large army the
dominions of Don Fernando: they now lay waste the fields;
burn the towns; steal and carry off property from palaces as
well as from huts; destroy churches; bear off women, both
single and married; and take prisoners and kill old people
and children, women and men!</p>

<p>"Up, up, knights and squires, those who pay taxes, and
those who do not! Hurry to Burgos, where the honoured
cavalier Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar has raised his green standard,&mdash;the
son of Diego Lainez, he who was born in a propitious
hour, he of the strong lance, he who fought at Atapuerca, he
who slew the Count of Gormaz, he who conquered Martin
Gonzalez of Aragon in single combat."</p>

<p>Such was the war-cry that resounded throughout Castile,
almost immediately after its invasion by the Moors, on the
day when we have seen Rodrigo abandoning his pursuit of the
Count Don Suero, in order to return to Burgos with the
intention of raising an army to march against the Moorish
power. And that cry did not resound in vain; from all sides
armed men hastened to Burgos, and already the cavalier of
Vivar had collected together a number sufficient to instil
terror into the invaders, who, like a wild torrent, which in
its rapid and devastating course tears up everything that lies
in its way, had rushed on from the right bank of the Duero to
San Estéban of Gormaz, then to the mountain chain of Oca,
and by the Sierra de Urbiad to Bureva, which it desolated,
without finding any resistance worth speaking of.</p>

<p>Rodrigo was burning with impatience to proceed to the
camp; but, as his prudence was equal to his valour, he did not
wish to give any advantage to the Moslems by leaving their
audacity unpunished, and disappointing the country by marching
against them an army incapable, by its numbers, of conquering
the terrible hostile forces. More than two hundred
cavaliers, related to him by blood, had hastened to obey his
summons, and even his nephews, the sons of his natural
brother, Don Fernando, were preparing to set out, notwithstanding
that they were all younger than Rodrigo.</p>

<p>The army was complete, and the hour of departure was
approaching. Rodrigo asked for the blessing of his parents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
who gave it to him both with their hearts and their lips, and,
embracing Ximena warmly, he mounted Babieca, at the same
time that Fernan went out to mount his steed, grumbling at
the cowardice and faint-heartedness of woman, for Mayorica had
not been able to restrain a flood of tears on seeing him set
out for the wars, for the young woman loved him more than
ever from the time that he had made peace with her.</p>

<p>The signal was given, and the brilliant army of the knight
of Vivar set out from Burgos in the direction of Bureva,
towards which the Moors were then advancing.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful morning, and as it had not rained for
some time, the road was in good condition. Thanks to this,
thanks to the desire that all had to attack the Moors, and
thanks, above all, to the fact that they had sallied forth from
Burgos before the sun had risen in the east, the troops arrived
at the mountains of Oca before midday, having been joined on
the way by additional large bodies of armed men. The
territory at the other side of the mountains had not yet come
in sight, when the scouts, whom Rodrigo had sent forward to
explore the country, returned to meet him, and informed him
that the Moors were beginning to ascend the opposite slopes
with great cheering, and other demonstrations of satisfaction,
doubtless on account of the booty they had seized on in
Najera, in Santo Domingo, and other districts of Rioja. On
learning that the enemy was approaching, all those who
composed the army uttered shouts of joy, and Rodrigo,
Fernan, and the sons of Fernando Diaz distinguished themselves
not the least in this show of enthusiasm and valour.</p>

<p>Rodrigo advanced the first, and on arriving on the highest
point of the mountain, he distinguished the vanguard of the
enemy, scarcely more distant than three shots of a crossbow.
As he had already given orders to his captains, as to the
manner in which the attack was to be commenced, he cried
out, putting his lance at rest and his shield in position&mdash;</p>

<p>"St James. St James!"</p>

<p>"St. James! onward, Spain!" was the cry which responded
to his,&mdash;a cry so resounding and so universal, that not alone
did the Moors hear it, but it even reached the level country.</p>

<p>Scarce was it given, than they rushed on the Moors, who
were broken up and thrown into disorder in a few minutes;
such being the terror that this unexpected and vigorous attack
caused them, that even the bravest warriors amongst them
thought at first of seeking safety in flight. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Abengalvon, the King of Molina, who was one of the five
who commanded the Moors, raised his voice, loud as thunder,
and was the first to face the Christians; his example encouraged
his squadrons. The conflict then became bloody
and obstinate; but the Castilian hosts, although inferior in
numbers, were superior in valour, and were fighting for their
God, for their country, and for their brethren kept in irons
and ill-treated in the Moorish dungeons. Their enemies were
therefore in a short time defeated and routed on all sides, and
the field of battle was covered with Moorish corpses.</p>

<p>The victory was complete: not a Moor had been able to
escape from the onslaught of the Christians, as a very large
number were killed in the battle, and the remainder were taken
prisoners. Everything was in the power of the cavalier of
Vivar,&mdash;the Moors who had not fallen under the blows of the
Castilian steel, the captives whom they had taken, and the
flocks and herds which they had seized on during their
devastating march. The cries of joy of the rescued prisoners,
and the agonised cries of the dying, were mingled together in
one great volume of sound.</p>

<p>Rodrigo, followed by his nephews and by Fernan, all
covered with the blood of the enemy, were riding over the
fields of battle, when the fight was almost terminated. Some
wailings, which seemed to be those of a child or of a woman,
came to their ears. Rodrigo hastily went in the direction
from whence they proceeded, and the sight which presented
itself to him moved his heart, which until then had been of
stone, notwithstanding the carnage that had taken place all
around him. An old Moor was breathing his last, and a boy,
a Moor also, and very young, was embracing him, uttering
cries of despair, as if he thought he could preserve the vital
heat which was leaving the dying man, by the pressure
against him of his small body. Rodrigo believed that the old
man was already dead, and made a sign with his hand to the
boy to approach him; but the dying man opened his dim
eyes, and, seeing that the young Christian warrior was showing
signs of compassion for the disconsolate child, he made a last
effort, and murmured with his failing voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"You, Christian captain, who are brave, and must therefore
be generous and good, will protect this unfortunate little
creature,&mdash;the only flower of the garden of my love. Oh,
Christian, have pity on my son, aid the helpless orphan!"</p>

<p>"He need never call himself by that name," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Rodrigo, filled with emotion, "for if he loses a father in you, he
shall find one in me."</p>

<p>"May Allah send a protector to your sons, if they should
ever be in need of one, and may the Prophet open to you the
gates of his holy paradise!" exclaimed the old man, and tears
of gratitude mingled in his eyes with those of death, which
oozed from them, as he fell back a corpse.</p>

<p>Rodrigo removed the unhappy child from the dead body of
his father, and ordered that he should be led to his tent,
lavishing on him all the consolations and endearments which
his condition required.</p>

<p>Some hours afterwards, the victorious army set out on its
return to Burgos, bringing with it the rich spoils which it had
taken from the enemy. The inhabitants of all the towns and
villages on the way crowded out to salute the conqueror, and
in many places there had been erected, as if by enchantment,
handsome triumphal arches of foliage, and the road had been
strewn with flowers, which perfumed the air. Enthusiastic
cheers arose as Rodrigo passed along, and the sounds of
drums and other instruments enlivened the country, mingling
with the fervent acclamations of the good Castilians.</p>

<p>What a happy day was that for Castile, for Rodrigo, for all
who loved him, and for all good people!</p>

<p>Before the squadrons rode the youthful commander, surrounded
by his relations and his captains; joy shone in his
countenance, and warlike enthusiasm sounded in his words.
Babieca moved on swiftly, but Rodrigo was wishing that he
had the wings of Pegasus, that he might arrive in Burgos
with the speed of lightning, for of what value were to the
son of Diego Lainez that victory, those triumphal arches,
those acclamations, those ovations of an enthusiastic and
grateful populace, compared with the triumph, with the
glory, with the love which awaited him in Burgos, beneath
the paternal roof? The happiness which filled his soul
made Rodrigo love all about him, and thus it was that
Babieca presented himself to his eyes from a point of view
different to that from which he might have seen him on any
other occasion.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Rodrigo, "this is not alone a day of triumph
for us men; but my good Babieca has gained glory also, and
I feel quite sure that his former master, my godfather Don
Peyre, will hold him in more esteem from this day forward.
With what intelligence he let himself be guided by my hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
in the combat! With what ardour and vigour he rushed on
the enemy!"</p>

<p>And he added, giving the noble animal a slap on the neck
with his hand, which raised his head as if he understood the
praises which his master was so freely giving him, and was
filled with pride by them&mdash;</p>

<p>"Babieca, if you have taken part in the efforts we have
made to win the victory, you also shall have a share in the
spoils of it; I promise to give you the handsomest trappings
that we have captured. Many another day, like this, you
shall have to fight against the Moorish forces, and mingle
your sweat with infidel blood. You shall be my companion
in camps and in cities, on the roads and in combats; and if
you ever want food and shelter, it will be only for the reason
that my lance has not been able to procure them for you."</p>

<p>If Rodrigo was well satisfied with the conduct of his steed
in the battle which he had just won, it was not so with Fernan
with regard to his.</p>

<p>"I vow by Judas Iscariot," said Fernan to some squires, on
hearing Rodrigo praise Babieca, "that my master must have
taken lessons from Beelzebub himself, to judge by the knowledge
he has of everything. It seemed to me that it was an
ass and not a horse that he selected in the stables of Don
Peyre; but he took it into his head that he was a good one,
and, as it has turned out, knight or squire never bestrode a
better. Now look at mine, which looks as if he were fit for
an emperor, and with all that he nearly left me in the clutches
of four Moors, as big as four Goliaths."</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it," said one of the squires, "for I have
an idea myself of what would likely happen you when you
followed into the ravine those who fled from the main body
of the army."</p>

<p>"I shall do so in a few words. I spurred on my horse after
four Moors, as tall as towers, and I continued the pursuit for
a considerable distance; I was nearly touching them with
my lance, when, just about jumping over a wide ditch, my
horse stopped; I spurred him violently, and he sprang forward,
but not far enough, and he went down into the ditch.
The Moors saw my mishap, and turned on me, crying out,
'You shall die there, Christian dog!' They had already raised
their powerful scimitars over my head, when Overo,<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ashamed,
I suppose of his conduct, made an effort, raised himself, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>got out of the ditch. 'It is ye that shall die,' I cried in my
turn; 'I vow it by the bones of Mahomet!' And closing
with the Moors, will ye, nill ye, two of them were transfixed
by my lance, and the others fled, without waiting to help
their companions."</p>

<p>"And you complain of your horse?"</p>

<p>"I find fault with him for good cause; and I would have
thrown him over a precipice, only that in the end he
retrieved his character; but if he ever acts in that way again,
I swear by the soul of Beelzebub that he shall not do so a
third time. I am always unfortunate with regard to horses."</p>

<p>"But you are very fortunate with regard to women, though
it is not quite the same thing," said Alvar; and he added
with a malicious smile, "If I only had such a sweetheart as
Mayorica, I would be satisfied with a bad ass."</p>

<p>Fernan heaved a deep sigh, drawn from him by the
remembrance of Mayorica, and also perhaps by that of
Beatrice and that of Aldonza.</p>

<p>"It is some time now since I saw scratches on your face,
Fernan," said a squire. "I suppose you have been faithful
to Mayorica?"</p>

<p>"I have been always so," replied Fernan, with much
seriousness, which caused his comrades to laugh maliciously.</p>

<p>"Aldonza would be able to testify to it; is not that so?"
retorted the inquisitive squire.</p>

<p>"And Beatrice also," added Alvar.</p>

<p>"I vow by Judas Iscariot, that you, Alvar, are the most
confounded chatterer that ever was known. Had the son of
my mother ever love-affairs with Beatrice?"</p>

<p>"But it was not your fault that he had not."</p>

<p>"By Beelzebub, I'll break every bone in your body as
soon as we dismount."</p>

<p>Alvar, who knew well the danger of offending the vanity of
Fernan, thought it best to retract what he had said; by that
he pacified the squire of Rodrigo.</p>

<p>Another, however, of the order of squires, named Lope,
a serious man, advanced in years, who had a wife and
children, and who some time before had been scandalised
by hearing of the liking of Fernan for plurality in love-affairs,
profited by the occasion to throw his weakness in
his face and to endeavour to convert the amorous squire.</p>

<p>"Brother," he said to him, "in vain will you try to persuade
us that you have been discreet in your love affairs; your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
weaknesses have been notorious in Vivar, in Burgos, in Leon,
and in all places where you have resided even a few days.
That an inexperienced youth should have as little sense as
you have might be tolerated, but such cannot be excused in
a man of your age. This Mayorica, to whom you pay your
homage, and whom I scarcely know,&mdash;if she is not worthy of
your affection, well, then, leave her, and do not continue to
look on her with carnal eyes; she will soon find another that
suits her, and you also one who may please you better. On
the other hand, if she is worthy of your affection, then,
brother, serve her with your soul and with your life; but do
not serve more than her, for to be in love with two women at
the same time will neither be pleasing to God nor to the
women. If not, tell me on your honour what you would do
if Mayorica shared her love with you and with another man."</p>

<p>"What I would do?" replied Fernan angrily. "I would
kill both Mayorica and the fellow that dared to look on her!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, brother, God has said, 'Do unto others as you
would that others should do unto you.' Love Mayorica faithfully,
if she is deserving of your love, and marry her if your
means permit it; for a woman without means to support herself
and the children that God may give her, is miserable in
her house."</p>

<p>"I shall do so, as soon as I am a little better off, and I
trust that will be in a very short time; for you must know,
comrades, that since the marriage of my lord and master, Don
Rodrigo, I am most desirous of getting married also; and if I
can't marry two, I must be satisfied with one. Besides, do
you think I would cease to love Mayorica if I took a fancy to
twenty or a hundred others? Your great simplicity astonishes
me, brothers. Does she who loves the child of her neighbour
love her own less? Certainly, since I fell in love with Mayorica,
I have also been in love with Leonora, Brianda, Sol, Alfonsa,
Ivana, Aldonza, Beatrice, and twenty more; but I only loved
them with my eyes, whilst I loved Mayorica with my heart,
and that is the only real love. Apart from that, I have got a
certain idea into my head, and all the preachers in the world
could not get it out of it, and that is: a man can safely be in
love with two women at the same time&mdash;provided that they do
not know of it."</p>

<p>"On my conscience, comrade, you are either very simple or
very depraved. Did that old witch, Mari-Perez, whom you
used to visit near the torrent, teach you that? According to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
you, if to-morrow you marry Mayor, and your wife, whilst you
are away on a campaign, should be seduced by another man,
it would be no harm as long as you did not know of it. What
answer have you to that?"</p>

<p>Fernan bowed his head and remained silent in face of this
argument of Lope. The conviction, which he said all the
preachers in the land could not overcome, had just been
pulverised by that rough squire.</p>

<p>"Lope," he said at last, "you have convinced me. I confess
to you that until to-day I have been blind, and have
understood love-affairs no better than my horse. I swear to
all of you, that even if Beelzebub himself should come to
tempt me in the shape of the best-looking girl in the world,
I would not let myself fall into temptation."</p>

<p>"I hope in goodness," Alvar ventured to say, "that the
witch, Mari-Perez, who has her power from Satan, will not
make you fall into temptation by presenting the devil to you
under the form of Aldonza."</p>

<p>"Have no fear of that, Alvar, for if such a devil should
appear before my eyes, I would drive him away, not with holy
water, but with the reins of my horse. I'd like to confess one
thing, now that we're speaking of Aldonza. You know, comrades,
that I was in love with her once; but I think only
through the witchcraft of her mother. Well, then, I took a
turn against her on account of a certain kind of caresses which
she lavished on me one morning, and I swore I'd never look
on her as long as I lived. But as time went on, I began to
think of her again, also, I believe, by reason of the incantations
of her mother; and I was almost tempted to hunt her up
once more, when I learned yesterday that Don Suero had
brought her off to his castle at Carrion; stolen, according to
what Mari-Perez says, but, as I believe, of her own free will.
My soul was fired by this act of Don Suero, whom I look on
as an enemy since the time when my master and I fought with
him and his followers in order to rescue Beatrice, whom they
were forcibly carrying off; and I thought of seeking out the
Count of Carrion, in order to take the girl away from him; but
I now swear that I shall do no such thing, and that from this
day forward I shall have nothing to do with any woman except
Mayorica."</p>

<p>"I trust in God it may be so," said Lope; "but he who has
bad habits"&mdash;</p>

<p>The worthy squire was interrupted by the exclamations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
some of his companions, who, on seeing at the door of a house
near the road three or four maidens, as bright-looking as May
roses, commenced to address tender words to them, at which
they laughed and seemed much pleased.</p>

<p>"I vow by Judas Iscariot, that girls like these are enough
to make even a saint go wrong. What eyes, what complexions,
what figures, what sprightliness!"</p>

<p>And, thus speaking, Fernan stopped his horse to gaze on
the young girls, and seemed even inclined to ride towards
them. However, as his comrades, far from imitating him,
continued their onward course, laughing at him, he rode on
to overtake them, muttering rather angrily, and looking up
towards heaven&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Lord, you have created angels like those who stand at
the door of that house, only that fools like my companions
may pass them by without being thankful for such wonders.
What faint hearts the majority of men have!"</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE ARMY OF RODRIGO MARCHED BACK TO BURGOS
WITHOUT BEING WEARIED, AS THE READER MAY BE</p></blockquote>


<p>The conversation of the squires and pages was resumed when
Fernan overtook them.</p>

<p>"We were talking of the girls you were in love with," said
Alvar, "but did you ever seek out Beatrice, to pay your
attentions to her again?"</p>

<p>"I have sought to soften her, but in vain," replied Fernan.
"Every time I go to the castle of Vivar, I have to pass near
the farmhouse of Pero, and the devil sometimes tempts me to
go in; and I cannot look on Beatrice without burning myself
with her eyes. But she, the ungrateful hussy, always puts on
a most scornful look. But I am certainly astonished at such
constancy in a woman, who has not seen her betrothed since
she was near being carried off to Carrion, and which same
gentleman seems to have forgotten her, as he takes no trouble
to see her again."</p>

<p>"But he has seen her, my friend," replied Alvar, who, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the reader will remember, had been also in love with Beatrice,
and therefore had managed to keep an eye on her, and had
endeavoured to gain her affections with greater zeal even than
Fernan; taking good care, however, that the latter should
know nothing about it.</p>

<p>"What do you say, friend Alvar?" exclaimed Fernan, full
of curiosity, and also somewhat angrily.</p>

<p>"I tell you, brother, that Martin has been at Vivar, and in
the house of Pero. Mine own eyes have seen him, and mine
own ears have heard Beatrice speaking to him. Know, however,
comrade, that the young man is not a rustic, as people
think, but a cavalier armed at all points."</p>

<p>"Alvar, you were always a simpleton, and imagined you
saw visions. When did you see and hear that? I suppose it
was after drinking too much wine in some inn."</p>

<p>"The night I saw and heard it there was not a drop of wine
in my body."</p>

<p>"What night was it?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you how it was. I am very fond of walking at
night through the fields; for when it is fine weather, and the
moon shines bright, and the day has been hot"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I swear by Judas Iscariot! Have done with your roundabouts!"
exclaimed Fernan, beginning to get impatient with
the circumlocutions of which Alvar was so fond.</p>

<p>"I wish to say," he repeated, "that when the weather is
fine, and the moon shines, and the day has been hot"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I swear," cried Fernan, again interrupting him, "that if
you don't get quickly from the straw to the grain, you shall feel
the flat of my sword. Was there ever such a stupid bore as
this fellow is?"</p>

<p>"Pardon, friend Fernan, I shall not again abuse your
patience. Well, then, you must know that, wandering one
night over the fields which Pero cultivates, I heard the steps
of a horse on the road that leads from Carrion. I approached
it, and concealed myself behind a fence. Then I saw a horseman,
well armed, approaching, and, by my faith, his steed was
fit for a king&mdash;what fire, what a step! I'd swear he was of the
breed of Don Suero's celebrated mare. One must be blind
and stupid not to know the horses of the Grandee of Carrion."</p>

<p>"'Fore God! I'll break your bones if you don't get on
quickly to the main point."</p>

<p>"Then I shall, Fernan. The cavalier dismounted at the
door of Pero's house and entered&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then?" asked Fernan, with impatient curiosity.</p>

<p>"Nothing more. How could I hear what they were saying
inside?"</p>

<p>"I swear that the story of this fool is rather interesting,"
remarked Fernan.</p>

<p>"I could not hear what they were saying in the house, but
I remained concealed behind the fence fully an hour, to see
if the cavalier would come out, and if I could discover who
he was by what he might say before his departure. At last I
heard the door opening. Beatrice was holding a candle in the
porch, and, thanks to its light, I was enabled to see what took
place there. Pero and his wife embraced the cavalier, Beatrice
was weeping, and I distinctly heard the name of Martin pronounced.
The stranger crossed the threshold at last and
mounted his horse. The young girl gave the candle to her
mother, followed him a short distance from the house, and
said to him, 'Martin, since you are resolved not to abandon
this vengeance, do not forget that if you die in carrying it out,
I also shall die of grief.' 'Trust to my love, Beatrice, and it
will bring you happiness,' replied the cavalier, and he disappeared
like a flash of lightning."</p>

<p>"And how long is it since that happened?" asked Fernan.</p>

<p>"I remember it as if it only happened yesterday, for I
have a good memory. Memory is a valuable"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alvar! make use of your memory to remember how I
punish stupidities. Is it long since that happened?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember the exact time; but I know it was
at the period when the band of the Vengador was proceeding
to Burgos."</p>

<p>"And now that you mention the band of the Vengador,"
said one of the squires, "do you know the news that is going
about concerning it?"</p>

<p>On hearing these words, all tried to get their horses as near
as possible to him who pronounced them. This general
anxiety to learn something of the band of the Vengador,
showed that it had acquired such importance that public
attention in Castile was fixed on it.</p>

<p>"What news of it have you?" was asked with lively
curiosity.</p>

<p>"You must know, as has been related to me by men-at-arms
coming from the neighbourhood of Carrion, that the Vengador
has now got together more than three hundred bandits,
and with them he not only laughs at the Salvadores, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
faces them, and has even defeated them in two skirmishes, so
that the Count of Carrion, seeing his district and even his
castle threatened, proceeded to it with the greatest speed,
having left Burgos, where he had recently fixed his
residence."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," observed Fernan, "the bandits caused the
count to leave Burgos; but the reason he went off with such
rapidity was because he was afraid that the lance of my
master might reach him. However, leaving that aside, for
it does not much matter, can't you tell me who this Vengador
is, who has gained so much fame in so short a time, and who
has got together so numerous a following?"</p>

<p>"As to the Vengador, nobody knows who he is, as he
always conceals his face when he is in the presence of persons
who are not members of his band."</p>

<p>"I am of opinion," said Alvar, "that, as he conceals himself
in that way, he must be a grandee of Leon or Castile, who has
become a brigand in order to revenge himself on his enemies."</p>

<p>"It is more probable that he is a civilian, for it is said
that he has a mortal hatred for all who call themselves noble,
and that he protects the peasantry, and even shares with them
what he takes from the grandees."</p>

<p>"But how did he manage to get together such a numerous
band, when the Raposo, who is now in hell as he deserves,
was never able to get more than twenty to join him."</p>

<p>"Well, then, the reason is&mdash;the Raposo was hated by the
country people, whilst the Vengador is loved by them."</p>

<p>"May the devil take me if I understand you, comrade.
How is it possible that a captain of bandits can be loved
by either peasants or nobles?"</p>

<p>"It is possible, and that is proved by the fact that the
Vengador has succeeded in it. The Raposo carried off
women; murdered children and old people, from the peasant
to the count, from the curate to the bishop; he pillaged the
cabin of the labourer and the hut of the shepherd, as well
as churches and palaces. Therefore all hated him, and did
their utmost to deliver him up to the Salvadores, and plotted
his destruction in every way they could. Who, that had any
respect for his skin, would enlist under such a chief, for he
who did so was also abhorred and cursed by all, and ran
continual risk of his life? The Vengador acts in quite a
different way; his dagger is never stained by human blood,
except in self-defence, or fighting in the cause of the helpless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
unjustly oppressed by the strong; the poor man can leave the
door of his cottage open; the muleteer can travel safely along
the loneliest roads, as there is no danger of the band of the
Vengador depriving him of his humble possessions. Inquire
how many women the band of the Vengador has carried
off, how many churches he has pillaged, and you will be told
that such outrages are unknown in the districts which it
frequents, since the time that the Salvadores destroyed the
band of the Raposo."</p>

<p>"Then if the band of the Vengador does not commit
robberies," observed Alvar, "I hold to my opinion, that its
captain is some rich grandee; how else could he have money
to support it?"</p>

<p>"He does commit robberies, brother; but he does not rob
poor people. The Vengador attacks the mansions of the rich
and takes from them all that he can. With that he maintains
his band, and when he has more than he wants for that purpose,
he relieves the necessities of the poor people in his
vicinity. That is why the peasants love and respect him; and
his band can encamp wherever he likes, without any risk of
falling into the hands of the Salvadores. And for the same
reasons the number of his followers increases from day to
day."</p>

<p>They were still speaking of the band of the Vengador when
Alvar, who was fond of saying what he considered witty
things, but which were generally very foolish, took it into
his head to say something which he believed would create
a sensation amongst his companions.</p>

<p>"My friends," he remarked to them, with much mystery,
"I desire to impart a piece of news which I believe won't be
such for some of you."</p>

<p>All the squires and pages stopped at once their sprightly
conversations, in order to listen to what Alvar had to reveal
to them.</p>

<p>"My mistress, the Senora Ximena, bears the reputation
of being an irreproachable lady throughout all Castile; is
not that so?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, and with good reason," was the universal
answer; and Fernan added&mdash;</p>

<p>"And if any calumniator were to cast a doubt on the
honour of my lady, I have a lance here to convince him
of it."</p>

<p>"It is not me who would calumniate her," continued Alvar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
in the same mysterious manner; "but I must tell you that my
master, Don Rodrigo, although he has only just got married,
and never had any sweetheart but Doña Ximena, has a son,
a fine little chap."</p>

<p>"I vow by Judas Iscariot!" exclaimed Fernan, seizing his
lance, fire flashing from his eyes. "What is that you dare
to say, you villain, you traitor? Does your scorpion tongue
dare to calumniate your mistress, the most honoured lady,
not alone of Spain, but of the entire world? For this ingratitude
to those who supply you with the bread you eat, you
shall die, traitor that you are!"</p>

<p>Saying this, he made a thrust of his lance at Alvar, forcible
enough to pierce a wall; but his anger blinded the squire,
and caused him to miss his aim; to this also contributed a
rapid movement of the page, who threw himself back on
his saddle-bow just as Fernan was giving the thrust.</p>

<p>All those who saw what had occurred hastened to pacify
the enraged squire, some with words and others by seizing his
arms from behind.</p>

<p>"Let me go, let me go!" cried Fernan, struggling to get
free, so that he might attack Alvar again, who hardly had
breath to excuse himself. At last they quieted him down
a little, and he said in threatening accents to the page&mdash;</p>

<p>"Speak, you rascally traitor, and retract the calumnies that
you have dared to utter against the most honoured of women.
If you don't do so at once, I'll spit you on my lance like a
sucking pig."</p>

<p>"Calm your anger, Fernan," murmured the page at last
"It was not in my mind to stain the characters of my lord
and lady, but to praise the compassionate and kind heart
of Don Rodrigo."</p>

<p>"Confound you for a stupid chatterer: have I not told you
a hundred times that your roundabout way of stating the most
simple facts would certainly get you into trouble some day or
other?" said Fernan, understanding at last what the page
had intended to convey in his would-be witty style. "Speak
out, you fool, and tell us what son it is that our master has."</p>

<p>"The little Moor that he picked up after the battle,
when you left us to run after the four big Moors to the ditch
into which your horse fell. That is what I was going to
speak about, and I was only having a little joke with you,
in order to excite your curiosity."</p>

<p>"I swear to you, Alvar," said Fernan, brandishing his lance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
"that such jokes may cost you dear, if you persist in them.
A respectable page or squire can be pleasant without defaming
the honour of anyone, and least of all that of ladies, for even
the purest cannot escape calumny."</p>

<p>"And I swear to you," replied Alvar, "that from this day
forward I will cut out my tongue rather than say, even in
jest, a word against either my mistress or master. My discretion
with regard to speaking about people will increase, but
my affection for those we both serve can never be greater than
it is. But, returning to the little Moor, whom my master has
adopted, what has become of him, that we do not see him?"</p>

<p>"He is coming along amongst the captives," answered
Fernan; "and, by my faith, neither he, nor the Moorish kings
who have been taken prisoners, can complain, for they are
carried in litters, as if they were going to the court as
conquerors."</p>

<p>"God save us!" exclaimed Alvar; "my master does things,
and I am a Moor if I understand them. Some of the Christians
are jogging along on horseback, with sore bones, and others
are blistering their feet on these roads, hard as those of purgatory,
and the Moors are quite comfortable in soft litters."</p>

<p>"You fool, and a hundred times more than a fool, who
has given you authority to find fault with what our master
does?" interrupted Fernan. "He is so good a subject that he
respects even Moors when they bear the name of king,&mdash;even
though they may be greater Moors than Mahomet himself."</p>

<p>"However, if they were kings before they were conquered,
they are now no longer such."</p>

<p>"Good cavaliers, like our master, have more respect for
a conquered enemy than for one whom they have still to
conquer. No doubt those kings entered our territories pillaging
and slaying, but they believed that they were right in
doing so, just as we would think the same if we invaded
their kingdoms. As to the Moorish child, would you yourself
like to see him painfully toiling on amid the legs of
our horses. The heart of our master is as tender towards
the weak as it is stern towards the strong, and he has thought
and acted in a different manner. That poor boy, who has
seen his father die before his eyes, and who is being brought
into a foreign country at the mercy of strangers, is very unfortunate.
On account of his grief and despair, Don Rodrigo
ordered that he should be carried in the litter of one of the
kings, as the company of one of his own race would naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
be more pleasing to him than that of a stranger. You will
see how our mistresses, Doña Teresa and Doña Ximena, will
console him when he arrives at Burgos, with those blessed
words which they have always ready, to give joy to the sad
and consolation to the wretched."</p>

<p>With conversations such as these the squires and pages
were proceeding onward, when Rodrigo and those who accompanied
him stopped on an extensive plain, at a short distance
from Burgos, from which several roads branched off in various
directions. According as the different bodies of warriors
arrived, they halted in that place, and, when they were all
reunited, Rodrigo summoned together the leaders, in order
to proceed to the division of the spoils, according to the
rules which were observed on such occasions.</p>

<p>As the spoils were numerous and valuable, everyone got
a good share, which, with the fact that the division was fair
and equitable, contributed much to the satisfaction and pleasure
of all who participated in them.</p>

<p>After this the army broke up, each captain marching off
his men to his own district. All of them, when departing,
bade farewell to Rodrigo with loud and prolonged cheers.</p>

<p>It is almost unnecessary to add that, if the captains of the
various bands received such valuable shares of the spoils,
that portion which their general, Rodrigo, received was very
rich indeed. He then proceeded to Burgos with all that
had been allotted to him, bringing on amongst the captives
the five Moorish kings, who, according to the "Chronicle,"
on arriving at Burgos, knelt with great respect before Teresa
and Ximena, who were very pleased and contented therewith,
and praised the Lord God, weeping with joy on account of
the brave deeds which Rodrigo had performed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE VENGADOR AND RUI-VENABLOS, ALTHOUGH ONLY
BANDITS, THOUGHT AS CAVALIERS</p></blockquote>


<p>Some days had passed and the district of Carrion had not experienced
any fresh outrages from bandits, when its honest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
peaceful inhabitants heard the news of the destruction of the
band of the Raposo by the brotherhood of the Salvadores.
There was no doubt that the terrible band had been totally exterminated,
since its chief, who had often escaped even when
all his comrades perished, had been killed in the attack made
on them, which has already been described. It is easy, then, to
imagine the joy which all the inhabitants of that part of the
country experienced, and also that of all those who had to
travel through it.</p>

<p>But, when it was least expected, a rumour began to be
circulated from mouth to mouth that a portion of the criminals
had reorganised themselves in the Sierra de Oca, and had
already made forays into the level country. This new band
was at first composed of scarcely a dozen men, but on that
account it did not inspire the country people with less terror.
The band of the Raposo was not much larger, and, nevertheless,
it had spread mourning and desolation all over the
district. But it happened that the terror of the peasantry,
instead of increasing, began to diminish, as the bandits confined
their raids to the populous towns and most frequented
roads; and for that reason the fear of the wealthy classes
increased in proportion. It is not necessary to explain the
reason of this, as it has already been done in the remarks
of one of the pages in the army of Rodrigo, which have been
given in the preceding chapter. What he had told his companions
was quite accurate. The band of the Vengador had
indeed increased rapidly; it had faced the Salvadores, and
even defeated them in different encounters, provoked, as it
was said, by the bandits themselves, with the object of
avenging the death of the Raposo and the greater part of
his followers, who had been killed by them on the hill near
the Leon road. The Vengador, protecting, instead of doing
injury to the country people, carrying off the herds and crops
of the grandees, and even assaulting, sacking, and burning
their mansions, was by degrees getting to be loved by the
former and detested by the latter. Thus it happened that
the band, respected and protected by the poor, and attacking
with impunity wherever its leader thought fit, was joined, day
after day, by discontented people, adventurers, criminals, and
idlers; very many of whom hastened to enlist in it.</p>

<p>Don Suero had received notice of the outrages it had
committed in the country about Carrion, and had also learned
that the terrible band had just stolen the famous mare of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
which he was the owner. All this urged him to leave Burgos
and hasten on to defend his property, as his castle was situated
in the centre of the district, that is in the town which gave
it its name. It was now threatened by the bandits, and already
other castles less strong than his had been attacked, sacked,
and burned by the band.</p>

<p>The fears of the count were not unfounded, as we shall
soon see. On the day on which Don Suero hastened his
departure from Burgos, fearful also, as Fernan said, of the
lance of Rodrigo, the band of the Vengador was assembled
in a wood, a day's journey distant from Carrion. That body
did not appear to be a band of bandits; judging by its
numbers, its arms, and by the orderly way in which it was
marshalled, it seemed rather a regiment of a regular army,
such a one as the best captain might wish to have under his
command in a campaign against the Moors. The bandits
were provided with excellent arms, both offensive and defensive,
had good horses, and obeyed the orders of their chief
like the best disciplined soldiers. He, the Vengador, or, if
the reader prefers it, Martin, had retained to himself the
chief command of the band, and had appointed to inferior
positions in it those amongst his followers whom he considered
most suited to fill them; to these he gave the title of captain,
calling himself the chief. Two had been appointed captains,
both having had considerable experience in military matters,
as they had served during several years, as men-at-arms, in
the pay of various masters; sometimes in the campaigns
against the Moors, and on other occasions in the civil strifes
which at that period were unfortunately but too frequent
amongst the grandees of Castile and Leon. The name of
one of these was Bellido Dolfos, that of the other Rui-Venablos;
the first was formidable on account of his vindictive
and cunning disposition, the second for his colossal strength,
his bravery, and his calmness in the greatest dangers.</p>

<p>The place in which the band was assembled had all the
appearance of a regular camp, as tents were set up here and
there, over which were fixed military trophies. The Vengador
had summoned the two captains to his tent, and was there
conversing with them in a very animated manner.</p>

<p>"I have summoned you," he said, "as I desire to have
your advice. Do you think our forces are sufficient to attack
the Castle of Carrion?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Rui-Venablos, "I answer for the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
of the enterprise. What avail the fifty crossbow-men whom
the count retains for the defence of his castle, compared with
the three hundred brave fellows who compose our band? I am
rejoiced to see that you have decided to attack that traitor
count, for you must know that our men are beginning to
get dissatisfied with you, as you first stirred up their hatred
against him, and then prevented them from reducing his castle
to ashes."</p>

<p>"I have waited for an opportune moment to undertake
that enterprise, so that my vengeance may be complete. The
count has not been at his castle since he went to Calahorra,
on the occasion of the combat between the cavalier of Vivar
and Martin Gonzalez, as he went direct from it to Burgos
with the Court. We should have found in the castle two
children, eight or ten years of age, and a lady, who is as good
as her brother is bad. The band of the Vengador does not
wreak vengeance on such weak beings. What advantage
could we then have gained by attacking the castle? Plunder
it and burn it? That would be but a small punishment in
comparison with that which Don Suero deserves. If he were
one of those poor grandees, whom the burning of his castle
would leave without a home, as he could not build another,
the blow would be a heavy one; but the Count of Carrion
is one of the wealthiest grandees in Spain. For something
more than the frightening of a lady and two children, the
plundering of a well-appointed mansion, and warming oneself
with the flames of a burning castle, have the men of the
band of the Vengador to risk their skins."</p>

<p>"May the devil take us if we understand you!" said
Bellido and Rui-Venablos. "If that appears a small revenge
to you," added the latter, "of what kind is that which you
desire to have?"</p>

<p>"The vengeance which I ardently desire, that which our
people are resolved on, and which is demanded by the
wickedness of the count, and by the slaughter of the band of
the Raposo by the Salvadores, chiefly founded by Don Suero,
is his death."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, that is the vengeance we should take,"
said Rui-Venablos. "But how will it be if the count is in
Burgos?"</p>

<p>"The count," replied Martin, "is now in Carrion, and that
is why I believe that the opportune time has arrived to attack
the castle."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us lose no time, then," exclaimed Rui-Venablos, much
excited; "let us hasten to the den of that accursed count; let
us break open its gates with our hatchets; and let us plunge
our swords into the heart of that murderer of peasants and
carrier-off of women."</p>

<p>"We must have revenge on the Count of Carrion, but not
in the way you think," said Bellido, who until then had
remained silent, and as if thinking over some important
project. "The Castle of Carrion is strongly fortified and has
brave men-at-arms to defend it. Do you consider it prudent
to expose our unprotected breasts to arrows and other
projectiles, whilst those who hurl them against us are protected
by the turrets and ramparts of the castle? To act so
would be excusable if there were not another plan more
certain and less dangerous."</p>

<p>"And what is the plan you are thinking of?" asked, at the
same time, the Vengador and Rui-Venablos.</p>

<p>"It is this," replied Bellido. "The count fears, no doubt,
that some day, when he is least expecting it, we shall make a
sudden attack on his castle, and for that reason he will lose no
opportunity of reinforcing its garrison. Well then, I will
present myself to Don Suero as a soldier who desires to enter
his service, and I am sure I shall be well received. Once
having gained entrance into the castle, our band shall approach
it during the night, and with all possible caution. On a signal,
arranged beforehand, I shall open the postern-gate, the band
will enter by it, we will surprise the garrison and its inhabitants,
and, without any risk, will make ourselves masters of the
fortress in a very short time, together with all it contains,
including the count."</p>

<p>If Bellido had carefully observed the faces of the Vengador
and Rui-Venablos, he could have easily guessed the reception
which his proposition would receive. Indignation and contempt
were stamped on the countenances both of the chief
and of the captain, when Bellido Dolfos concluded the
description of his project.</p>

<p>"Brother," Martin replied to him, with an ironical smile,
"do you propose this seriously to us, or do you only wish to
find out if we are as great cowards as the count whom we
intend to attack, for we should be even more cowardly and
treacherous than Don Suero himself were we to do what you
propose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rui-Venablos, "explain yourself; for if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
have cowards and traitors here it is not necessary to go to
seek them at Carrion."</p>

<p>Bellido could not conceal his vexation on hearing these
words, although he was a skilled master in the art of dissimulation,
when such was necessary for the accomplishment
of his ends.</p>

<p>"May hell take me if I do not punish your insults!" he
exclaimed, putting his hand on his dagger.</p>

<p>The Vengador and Rui-Venablos quickly unsheathed theirs,
and held them directed towards his breast.</p>

<p>"Traitor!" said the former, "if you move foot or hand, you
are dead."</p>

<p>Bellido recovered very quickly the command which he
almost always exercised over himself, and said, smiling, in an
apparently frank and natural manner&mdash;</p>

<p>"I knew well that you would not approve of my proposal,
for you are loyal and brave, as I like men to be. Comrades,
do not condemn me without hearing me. If I said that I
made such a proposition in order to test your valour, I should
only lie, which I have never been in the habit of doing. I
acted in full seriousness, not because it would be pleasing to
me to make the attack unfairly, even if those whom we are
about to assail are traitors, but because I fear that our forces
will be of no avail against the strong walls of the Castle of
Carrion, and because I love so much the brave fellows, who
trust in our prudence, that I would prefer to shed all my blood,
rather than that a drop of theirs should be lost. You might
well consider me a coward if I proposed an enterprise to you
in which I myself would have little trouble or risk; but tell
me, whose will be greatest in carrying out the project which I
described? Do you not think that I shall run more danger
than any other member of the band, of being hung on the
battlements of the Castle of Carrion?"</p>

<p>The excuses of Bellido were not of much weight, to speak
the truth; his reasonings were those of one who does not
know what to say, and only says something because he must
do so; however, they sufficed to pacify the Vengador and Rui-Venablos,
as they, although exercising the by no means
honourable profession of bandits, were endowed with a
certain amount of good faith, and besides, they knew that
it was not a convenient time to do anything that might cause
division in the band. Martin therefore answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brother, let us forget this matter; I do not doubt your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
good intentions. But do not be astonished at our having
been filled with indignation and anger on hearing such a
proposal made to us, one unworthy of men who have hearts
and arms, and which would make us appear to the eyes of the
whole country cowards and traitors as vile as the Count of
Carrion. There are some who may say, 'Set a traitor to punish
a traitor'; but I say, and also all those whose hearts are not
cowardly and base would say, that it is an honourable man
who should punish a traitor. If you fear to expose your
breast to the bolts which will be shot down on us from the
crossbows of Don Suero, you are at full liberty to leave the
band before it enters on this enterprise; but if not, prepare
your arms, inform your men, as we shall also do, that to-morrow
at nightfall they are to march upon Carrion; that the count
must die, and that his castle must be destroyed; or that we
ourselves must lose our lives in the attempt."</p>

<p>"Anger of God!" exclaimed Bellido. "If another had
thrown any doubt on my courage, he should e'er this have felt
the point of my dagger. With you, comrades, I desire to
conquer or to die."</p>

<p>"Right, brother, right!" said Martin and Rui-Venablos,
and they held out their hands to Bellido Dolfos, who pressed
them, with force perhaps, but we will not say with sincerity,
for Bellido was as treacherous as Judas, and sooner or later he
was sure to avenge himself, in some cowardly way, on anyone
from whom he believed he had received an insult.</p>

<p>A short time after he had left them, he was walking in a
solitary place, not far from the encampment, now and then
striking his forehead with his clenched hand and muttering a
blasphemy, as if vexed by his want of imagination; he
suddenly stopped, however, meditated for a moment, more
deeply than before, and then pleasure beamed in his eyes and
a smile came on his lips, whilst he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Excellent thought, not one of them shall escape! Oh,
my cleverness is well worth the two hundred gold marks!
Night is now coming on; I must try to get, on some pretence,
to Carrion."</p>

<p>He then proceeded to the tent of the Vengador, and said to
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the Burgos road lives a girl that I am in love with.
I should like to see her, in case I may be killed during to-morrow's
attack."</p>

<p>"You can go if you so desire, comrade," replied Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I shall depart at once, as you give me permission,"
said Bellido.</p>

<p>He then went to his tent, as joyful and contented as
Rodrigo Diaz could have been when he was returning to
Burgos after the battle in the mountains of Oca.</p>

<p>When the night was well advanced he mounted his horse
and started for Carrion, although, when leaving the camp, he
rode in an opposite direction.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE SINGLE PAINT THE LIFE OF THE MARRIED</p></blockquote>


<p>Some hours after the events which happened in the encampment
of the bandits, as we have just described, the scenes
which we are about to relate took place in the Castle of
Carrion.</p>

<p>Ten years before the period in which this history commenced,
Don Gonzalo, Count of Carrion, died, leaving two sons,
the elder named Gonzalo and the younger Suero, and also a
daughter named Teresa. Gonzalo inherited the title of count,
but also died in a short time, Suero succeeding him, to whom
Teresa should be heiress, and after her two boys, both very
young, Diego and Fernando, whom Gonzalo, the younger, had
left behind when he died.</p>

<p>The heirs presumptive, within a certain degree of relationship,
bore the name of <i>Infantes</i>, and that is the reason that
Teresa and her nephews, Diego and Fernando, appear with
that title in the "Chronicle."</p>

<p>Teresa was scarcely eighteen years of age at the time of
which we are writing. God had endowed her soul with all the
perfections and virtues that an angel might desire, if he left
heaven in order to seek a mortal woman as his companion for
eternity, just as all those perfections had been denied to her
countenance, which are the only charms sought for by men,
when they look on a woman as a material being. Teresa, then,
was the reverse of her brother, both physically and morally;
her soul was all compassion, all love, all sadness. Her face
was as white and delicate as her soul, sad as her heart; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
her entire physique was languid and infirm, by which the
graces she had received from nature were concealed. That
sweet and candid dove appeared always desirous of spreading
her wings to mount again to heaven. If God had placed a
lyre in the hands of Teresa, her soul would have exhaled itself
in holy and immortal harmonies. But, alas! the sweet dove
lived for ever trembling, threatened by the cruel falcon, and
her angelic spirit was suffocating within the gloomy walls of
the Castle of Carrion.</p>

<p>There was a narrow window in it, from which could be seen
an extensive tract of country, covered with hamlets, the situation
of each of which could be at once recognised by its belfry.
Teresa delighted in sitting at that window, in order to gaze on
the azure of the sky and the verdure of the fields; and to
breathe the air sweetened by the perfumes of the flowers. But
those were not the sole enticements which attracted her to that
window: there were in addition happy souvenirs of her childhood.
In the distance, on the slope of a hill, Teresa could see
a smiling village; when gazing on it she was reminded of her
mother, and tears trickled from her blue eyes; but to this
remembrance of the loss of her mother was also joined that
of the happiness which she had enjoyed by her side. She
recalled to mind the delicious spring and autumn evenings,
when her mother and she left the castle alone and went to
wander through the fields, for then the affection of their vassals
was to the lord and lady of Carrion as the wing of the guardian
angel which protects the forehead of the righteous, just as,
from the time that Suero inherited the title, the hatred of his
retainers was as the sword of the archangel which constantly
threatened the head of Luzbel. Teresa and her mother went
in those times as far as that village, which could be seen from
the castle window; visited, on their way, the cottages of their
vassals, one by one, in order to console the sad and succour
the needy; and when the sun was near setting behind the hill,
they left the village crowned with blessings, and their hearts
refreshed by tears of joy and gratitude, in order to return to
the castle where the peace and tranquillity of the good, and a
father and husband, as loving as he was honoured, were awaiting
them. Some of the villagers accompanied them, in order
to act as their protectors, till they were near the castle, and
there, on the summit of a hill, crowned with evergreen oaks
and sown with sweet-smelling herbs, from whence the eye
could embrace an extensive view, the mother and daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
seated themselves, to gaze on the plain, illumined by the first
rays of the moon, to listen to the songs of the shepherds who
led their flocks to the sheepfolds, or those of the villager who
was leaving the fields with his bullocks and plough, and proceeding
to his home where his wife was impatiently awaiting
him, or, if a youth, the loving maiden, who, pretending to her
mother that she was going to the fountain, had left her house
to meet him in the grove, through which ran the brook that
served as a mirror to the country damsels. There also they
could hear the toll of the vesper bell from all the church
towers which were visible from the castle, and could lend an
attentive ear to those numerous mysterious and confused
sounds, which arise through the fields even when men and
birds are silent.</p>

<p>At that window Teresa was standing, absorbed in her
memories of former times, when she heard behind her the pitiful
whining of a dog, which was running towards her, as if imploring
her aid, and also the laughter of two boys, eight and
ten years old, who were following it with much noisy hilarity.</p>

<p>"Poor Leal, what is the matter with you?" said Teresa,
going up to the dog, which continued its sad whine. On
caressing the poor animal, she hastily drew back her hand, feeling
a painful sensation.</p>

<p>At the same time the boys came up.</p>

<p>"Aunt," said one of them, "give us some pins to stick in
Leal's other ear."</p>

<p>Teresa knew then why the dog was whining, and understood
the reason of the pain which she had felt in her hand when
stroking it. The boys had stuck pins in its ear.</p>

<p>"You cruel boys," she said to them, "what has Leal done
to you, that you should torture him so?"</p>

<p>"It's to make him sing," replied the elder brother.</p>

<p>"Aunt," said Fernando, the other boy, "give us pins to
stick them in his other ear, and you will hear him singing and
see him dancing."</p>

<p>Teresa heaved a sigh on seeing such cruelty on the part of
the boys, and hastened to extract the pins from the ear of the
dog, which ceased its whining and showed its gratitude by
caressing her and licking the hand from which blood still
trickled, caused by punctures of the pins.</p>

<p>At the same time the bell of the town church tolled for
evening prayer. The children continued, with much noise, to
make fun of what they had done to the dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be silent!" said Teresa to them, in a severe tone of voice;
"kneel down and pray for your mother."</p>

<p>"What's the good when we won't be heard?" replied Diego.
"Our uncle says that when one dies it is just the same as
when a dog dies."</p>

<p>"Yes, aunt," added Fernando; "our uncle says that, and
you know that he never says prayers."</p>

<p>"Alas!" exclaimed Teresa, filled with grief, "cruel and
impious at the same time." She then added, raising her eyes
towards heaven, "O my God! have pity on the house of
Carrion!"</p>

<p>She then knelt down, and directing her gaze on the blue and
star-covered firmament, which could be seen through the
window, she prayed fervently, moistening the floor with her
tears.</p>

<p>"Alas!" she murmured, shortly afterwards, again standing
at the window; "my heart is very sad! I fear and desire,
without knowing what! How sad and long the nights are, O
my God! Where can Guillen be? He has not come this
evening, as usual, to make more bearable, with his pleasant
conversation, this solitude which surrounds me. He is the
only one who feels compassion for me; he is the sole person
here who understands me, for his is the only generous and
good heart in the castle. What lofty feeling he has! With
what enthusiasm he speaks of everything that is good and noble!
The ambition which animates him is worthy of a cavalier. Son
of a poor commoner, he has a soul as noble as those of the
best grandees of Castile. Happy would be the maiden who
could gain his love!"</p>

<p>Teresa interrupted her meditations, as a soft and respectful
voice just then asked permission to appear in her presence.
The maiden willingly conceded it, and Guillen entered the
chamber.</p>

<p>"I thought you would not have come this evening, Guillen,
as it is now so late," remarked Teresa in a tone of sweet
reproach.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, lady," replied the page, with great sweetness;
"your brother, my master, has kept me occupied
till now"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, then," interrupted the sad maiden, with one of her
melancholy smiles, "as a punishment for your delay, I desire
that you sit down in that chair, and here, near the window,
and by the light of the moon, converse with me for a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
time, and relate to me the news of Burgos, for you have not
yet told it to me."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Guillen, moved by the kindness of
Teresa, "how generous and indulgent you are towards me, my
lady!"</p>

<p>He then seated himself opposite the young lady, near the
embrasure of the window; looking, however, at the face of
Teresa, he saw a tear still on her pale cheek, a tear which
sparkled in the rays of the moon, as the drop of dew suspended
on the leaf of a flower shines in the light of the rising sun.
Guillen was troubled, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lady, have you been weeping? Who has offended you?
Tell me, tell me, as I, though a humble page, son of a poor
man, have an arm and a heart to chastise anyone who dares
to offend my mistress"&mdash;</p>

<p>And Guillen stopped, fearing that the sentiments of his
heart might tempt him to say something which his position
would not warrant.</p>

<p>"No one has offended me, Guillen," replied Teresa, much
moved; "I thank you, however, for the interest you take in
me, for you are generous and good. I was thinking of my
mother, and that is why you have seen my cheek moist with
tears."</p>

<p>These words tranquillised the page.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me the news from Burgos?" continued the
maiden. "Since the Court moved thither, many things must
have happened worthy of being related. I have been told
that splendid festivities were celebrated in that city, on the
occasion of the marriage of the son of Diego Lainez and the
daughter of the Count of Gormaz."</p>

<p>"That, my lady, was the most notable event during our
stay in Burgos," answered Guillen in a low voice; "but I cannot
venture to speak of it, for you know that your brother, my
master, has commanded that the name of any of the family of
Vivar should not be mentioned in his castle."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Teresa; "but do not fear, for the count
cannot hear you in this chamber. Has the marriage been
one of love, or only by order of the king, as some say, in
order to prevent feuds which might have arisen between the
two families? Do not be surprised at my curiosity, Guillen,
for, knowing that the daughter of Don Gome and the son of
Diego Lainez are honourable and good, their happiness
interests me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, they are completely happy, my lady," exclaimed the
page. "You must know that Don Rodrigo and Doña Ximena
have loved each other since they were children, so you can
easily imagine how great their joy must be now that they are
united for ever! A garland of sweet flowers must be the
bonds of that marriage which joins those whose hearts were
already united by love."</p>

<p>An involuntary sigh escaped from the breast of Teresa on
hearing Guillen utter these words. She had contemplated in
her parents the happiness which the page described in such
enthusiastic words, and even without an example like that, her
own heart revealed such felicity to her. But, alas! the only
thing that Teresa had to expect was that some day her
brother would say to her, "I wish you to marry such or such a
nobleman; the interests of our family demand it; prepare to
go to the altar." And, miserable and resigned victim, she
would have to ascend the altar of sacrifice, to which fraternal
tyranny was leading her. And even if she had sufficient
courage to open her lips and say to her brother, "That which
you demand of me is the most barbarous of sacrifices; I do
not even know the man with whom you are about to unite
me with eternal bonds; the chains which are to bind me from
to-day are those of interest, are those of vanity, are those of
mean ambition, the tyranny of which may cause my soul to
rebel, and look with horror on her most sacred duties. The
nuptial blessing should only be the sanction of an agreement
arranged beforehand between two hearts. Permit that mine
may be united with another which throbs in unison with it,
and then I shall be a good wife, and a good mother, and will
bless the brother who left open for me the gates of Paradise."
Yes, it would be indeed useless to say this to her brother, for
that man without God, without law, without pity, would put a
gag in her mouth before she had even finished her entreaties,
and drag her, mute and helpless, to the altar of the inhuman
sacrifice. How could Don Suero understand the yearnings
of a soul, tender, loving, and compassionate, as was that of his
sister? How could he understand it, who himself did not
comprehend what love and compassion were&mdash;he who found
in violence the only means of triumphing over women?</p>

<p>All these bitter reflections crowded into the mind of Teresa
when the page had spoken that beautiful panegyric of a
marriage contracted through love. The two young people
remained silent for some moments: the thoughts of Guillen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
were not less sad than those of Teresa: first he thought of
the happiness that would be his if Teresa loved him, and if
they could be united, and this dream lulled him for a moment;
he then awoke from it, and thought how difficult, if not impossible,
the realisation of it would be. Who was he, to aspire
to be the husband of the noble sister of the Count of Carrion,
of the Infanta Doña Teresa, whose hand would honour the
most noble of the Castilian lords? And if Teresa, the goodness
of whose soul was of far greater worth than her birth,
should ever love him, was she mistress of her own hand?
Would the count, full of ambition, of pride, of hatred for
common people, permit his sister to bestow her hand on a
poor page, the son of a humble man? Then, however, a ray of
hope shone upon his mind, for hope and gilded illusions are
the inheritance of hearts which are enthusiastic and in love,
generous and good. He repeated to himself what he said to
his friends in Burgos on the day of the wedding of Rodrigo
and Ximena: "I am young, and not wanting in courage; I
will take a lance and fight against the Moors; I shall be
armed a knight, and then a hundred brave men will follow
me; I shall enter the Moorish territories, shall conquer them,
and shall be a lord over vassals, and then Don Suero will not
refuse me the hand of his sister." These foolish hopes, these
vain illusions, again strengthened his heart.</p>

<p>"The idea which you have conceived of those bonds is very
beautiful, Guillen!" said Teresa, abandoning her gloomy
reflections.</p>

<p>"Lady, is it not the same idea which you yourself have
formed?" replied the page.</p>

<p>"You will please me exceedingly if you explain yours to me
more fully, so that I may see if it corresponds with mine," said
Teresa. "The watches in the castle are so long and gloomy that
it is necessary to endeavour to pass them some way or other."</p>

<p>"I shall do so, my lady, if it pleases you," replied Guillen
with delight; for Teresa had afforded him an opportunity of
unburdening his soul, of telling her indirectly how he would
love her, and what the happiness of both of them would be if
a day should ever arrive when they could become husband and
wife.</p>

<p>"Lady," continued the page, "what great happiness it would
be if the soul could be shown on the palm of one's hand, like
a material object! If it were so, I would say to you, 'Gaze on
my thoughts, gaze on my soul, examine its deepest secrets.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
And you would read it with one look, you would know it such
as it is, you would comprehend the idea which you ask me to
explain to you with my lips. In the lives of two married
persons, united by love, joy and sadness, pleasures and pains,
happiness and grief, are mingled together and become common
to both; all sentiments, all feelings are dual, for each thinks
and feels for both. The maiden and the youth who have
desired for a long time to belong to each other, body and soul,
considering such a union as the supreme felicity of this world,
and one to which they have been looking forward from day to
day, from year to year, and reflecting over its future, from the
happy day on which they will be united by the priest, to that
on which death must separate them. Both would thus say,
'In the early days of our marriage we shall enjoy all the
illusions and joys of both lovers and spouses, and our hopes
will be even sweeter than now, for we shall have more confidence
in their realisation; new bonds will soon come to unite
us closer and closer, and those bonds will be beautiful little
creatures, whom we will love as parts of ourselves, and by whom
we shall be loved, not alone for the life which we have given
them, but also for the ceaseless care and affection which we
have lavished on them. We will not feel that our lives proceed
on towards the grave, for the plants which the sun of our love
has caused to spring up will remain beautiful and luxuriant,
above the tomb which shall cover our ashes, as the reproductions
of our beings.' Will not the maiden and the youth who
have had such ambitions, who have so reflected and have so
spoken, consider themselves happy? will they not believe that
they shall find that supreme felicity on the day when their
hopes begin to be realised, the day on which they become
each other's for ever? That, lady, is the way in which I look
on the happiness of those who are united to each other by
love. I do not even imagine them rich and surrounded by all
kinds of comforts and luxuries, although in that case the
picture would be still more enchanting, for misery and hard
work irritate the soul. I suppose them to be only poor
labourers, who by instinct alone preserve their souls pure and
open to good and elevated sentiments, for education and
intelligence have not perfected and developed their feelings.
They live in a rustic hut; the gardens which surround them
have been formed by nature, and it is nature that takes care of
them. In them grow the carnation, the mignonette, the
thyme, the sage, and a thousand other flowers and plants, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
perfumes of which rival those of the gardens created and cared
for by the hands of man. There are no trees there planted in
rows to form beautiful and shady walks, no fountains of water
to sparkle in the sunshine; but there grow there, scattered and
without order, trees bearing cherries, pears, figs, apples, nuts,
and other fruits, which exhale rich perfumes, delight the eye,
and supply food for the frugal rustics; and near that poor
dwelling is a spring which bubbles from the rocks, and which
fertilises the fields and quenches the thirst of those simple
people. The sounds of music and the incessant noise of cities
do not awake those peasants, but the crow of the cock, and,
later on, the warbling of the birds, which salute the dawn from
the leafy trees, amid which the humble dwelling appears
like a white dove, half concealed in foliage. Then the labourer
leaves his bed, in which he has enjoyed sound sleep, caused
by a good conscience, wakes up his wife with a loving kiss,
and impresses another on the smiling cheek of his child, who
still sleeps on, and dreams, sometimes imagining he is with
his mother, and sometimes that he is with the angels, who, as
he has been told, come down every night to watch over him.
The father then proceeds to the adjoining field, just as the
east is beginning to be tinged with gold and purple, announcing
the rising of the sun. Whilst he is working he hears, coming
from his cottage, songs which rejoice his heart. His wife is
singing whilst she performs her household duties, and her
songs sound to the ears of her husband as pleasing as the most
perfect music, for they are the same which she sang for him in
her maiden days, when they lovingly wandered through the
woods and fields. The sun shines fiercely and the work is
hard, but the labourer is not discouraged, for hopes encourage
him. In that field which he moistens with his sweat will
grow up golden corn which will enrich his granary. Evening
comes on, and then he realises another of the sweet hopes
which animate him; he quits the field and returns to his
cottage, where he is welcomed with tenderness and delight
by his wife, who has looked forward to that moment as a rich
reward for the labours of the day. What a beautiful picture
is then presented by that family, reunited around their
hearth! Lady, my words are too poor to describe it; your
own heart can imagine it."</p>

<p>Oh yes! the heart of Teresa pictured to itself that which the
page could not find words to describe, and understood the
scenes which Guillen had so imperfectly sketched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guillen," said Teresa, feeling her heart throb rapidly,
"you were right when you said that the idea you had conceived
of nuptial bonds sanctified by mutual love was the same
as that which I had formed of them. Alas! why were not my
parents poor peasants?"</p>

<p>"Why were not mine nobles?" exclaimed the page; and as
if frightened by his words, and fearful of revealing to that
noble maiden the love which burned in his heart for her, he
stood up from his seat, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Allow me to retire, my lady, for I am sure the count is
expecting me, and you know what punctuality he requires
from his attendants."</p>

<p>Teresa made no objection, and the page departed.</p>

<p>Was that indifference?</p>

<p>But when Guillen left her side she felt sad and unhappy, in
her heart was a great void.</p>

<p>Was that love?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE COUNT OF CARRION GAINED NOTHING BY
BULLYING</p></blockquote>


<p>Just at the time when Guillen was describing to Doña Teresa
the idea which he had formed of marriage accompanied by
love, a very different scene was being performed in the lower
portion of the castle, in the room which had been occupied,
and was now occupied again, by Sancha, the peasant girl,
whose father Don Suero had deprived of his sight. The
reader will have suspected who the girl was that the count
had carried off from Burgos; it was she who had assumed the
name of Aldonza at the time of her flight with Mari-Perez.</p>

<p>The girl was standing at a barred window which looked
out on the open country, for the Castle of Carrion consisted
of a square turreted tower, without exterior fortifications. At
her side stood Don Suero, addressing to her bitter reproaches,
to which she was listening with apparent disdain, gazing
indifferently on the fields lit up by a very bright moon.</p>

<p>"Ungrateful one," the count was saying, "did the love
which I felt for you deserve that you should fly from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
side as you did? Were you not the only woman to whom
the Count of Carrion ever humbled himself? What was
ever wanting to you in my castle?"</p>

<p>"I wanted liberty, and I fled away to seek it; I wanted
a father, of whom you, cruel man, deprived me, and whom I
have not succeeded in finding."</p>

<p>"And were not those privations easy to be borne, being
compensated by the comforts and luxuries which you enjoyed
in my castle, and more than all, by the love of the noble
Count of Carrion?"</p>

<p>The girl laughed, and replied disdainfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"More pleasant to me than the comforts and luxuries of
your castle have been the coarse apparel, the poor food, and
the wretched habitation of Mari-Perez, for they reminded me
of what I had in my childhood; and as to the love of the
noble Count of Carrion, that of a poor squire of the grandee
of Vivar was much more agreeable to me."</p>

<p>"May you be confounded!" exclaimed Don Suero, scarcely
able to speak with rage, for that was the first time that a
woman dared to scoff at him, and that jealousy tortured
his perfidious heart. "With tears of blood you shall weep
over your ingratitude; you shall never again see your father,
nor rejoice in that liberty which you sigh for so ardently,
nor enjoy any other love but mine."</p>

<p>The girl answered the threats of the count with another
loud burst of laughter, which caused his anger to rise to its
highest point. Don Suero then placed his hand on his
dagger, but the girl threw herself on his neck, changing
suddenly her sarcastic words and her disdainful smiles into
the sweetest and most caressing smiles and words that a
woman can assume, in order to disarm the anger of a
man.</p>

<p>"Thus do I like to see you, my love," exclaimed Sancha,&mdash;"thus
do I like to see you, for you appear to me the
handsomest of men when anger animates your countenance."</p>

<p>These words and the caresses of Sancha changed all at
once the tiger into a gentle lamb; that woman was beautiful,
but she was endowed with an animal and savage beauty, if
we may so express ourselves; for that reason did she exercise
such a powerful influence over the soul of the count, who set
no value on those quiet kinds of loveliness which are the
delight of cultivated and pure minds. Between the souls
of Don Suero and Sancha there was a marvellous affinity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
just as there was one, of a vastly different description, between
the souls of Guillen and Teresa.</p>

<p>"Sancha, Sancha!" murmured Don Suero, intoxicated with
pleasure, and returning the caresses of the wily peasant girl.
"What pleasure can you take in showing alternatively to me
hell and heaven?"</p>

<p>"In order that heaven may appear fairer to you, having
looked into hell," responded Sancha, redoubling her caresses.
"Oh, my love, what happiness awaits us in the Castle of
Carrion, if you do not force me to fly from it!"</p>

<p>"Fly from it?" cried the count, almost terrified; "no, no,
if you should do so again, this dagger will pierce my heart."</p>

<p>"Let your heart be entirely mine, and then I will love you
more than myself and never leave you. You have called me
ungrateful just now. How unjust you are, my love! Learn,
then, that I did not fly from you to seek freedom, nor even
to search for my father: I fled because you bestowed on
others the love which I thought should be mine alone. Do
you swear to amend your faults, and never again to set eyes
on any woman but me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sancha, I swear it to you."</p>

<p>"If you keep that promise, my sweet darling, how I shall
love you! But if not&mdash;I shall eternally hate you, and ever
despise you."</p>

<p>A few minutes after Don Suero left the chamber of Sancha,
and he might be heard to murmur, "This, this is heaven.
They are fools who seek it beyond this life."</p>

<p>Just at this time a voice was heard, calling out, "Hallo!
ye of the castle!"</p>

<p>The count heard it, and, as he recognised it, hastened to
order that the stranger should be admitted, impatience and
uncertainty exhibiting themselves on his visage and in his
words. The new-comer was at once introduced into his
presence, in one of the most private rooms of the castle.</p>

<p>"You are welcome," Don Suero said to him; "I was
expecting you with impatience. What tidings do you bring?"</p>

<p>"Bad," answered Bellido, for he was the man.</p>

<p>"May the wrath of God confound the bandits!" exclaimed
the count. "How is it that they can thus go on, mocking
the laws, with impunity? Why cannot some means be found
to exterminate them?"</p>

<p>"Calm your impatience, my lord, for you must not yet
abandon the hope, which my anxious desire to serve you has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
caused you to conceive. I have proposed to them what we
arranged, and they would not accept my plan; on the
contrary, they almost threatened my life for having believed
them capable of committing an act of treachery, for they look
upon the gaining entrance into the castle without fighting
as such."</p>

<p>Don Suero broke into loud laughter.</p>

<p>"Since when," he cried, "have bandits become so very
honourable? Perchance they have also converted you,
Bellido? So much the worse for you, however; for your
honour will cost you two hundred gold pieces, which I
promised you if you brought the Vengador and his band into
an ambush, in which they all might perish."</p>

<p>"Who has told you," replied Bellido, "that I have given
up the idea of earning the two hundred gold marks? Do
you imagine that Bellido Dolfos, when he undertakes an
enterprise, abandons it at the first check? Is it a small
matter to have enlisted in the band of the bandits; to have
borne hunger, cold, and fatigue; to have been at the very
head of the band whilst attacking the castles of twenty other
grandees&mdash;all to gain the confidence of the Vengador? After
all that, do you think I would renounce the fruit of my
labours because our plans have met with a slight check?
You know me but badly, count."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Bellido," said Don Suero, recovering the
hope which he had almost completely lost "I am so unlucky
that I thought there was no further expedient."</p>

<p>"We have still hopes."</p>

<p>"Tell me, then, what they are."</p>

<p>"I shall do so, if you listen to me without getting impatient."</p>

<p>"Speak, then, for I am very desirous of hearing you."</p>

<p>"The Vengador indeed spurned my proposal, but there is
another way to ensure the destruction of the band. We have
arranged that the castle shall be assaulted to-morrow night.
The plan adopted is to force the postern, to seize on the men-at-arms
who guard the castle; all this would be an easy
matter, as the Vengador has three hundred bandits, and the
garrison of the castle consists of only fifty crossbow-men.
Well, then, I have thought out a very simple plan to dispose
of the band: arrange the postern in such a way that there
will be but little difficulty in forcing it open; loosen the stones
of the arch which covers the first chamber inside that gate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
so that, on letting a heavy stone fall violently on the upper
part of the arch, it may give way at the opportune moment;
and finally, secure well the door between the first and second
chambers. As soon as the brigands get in through the
postern, they will rush to the next door, and whilst they are
occupied in forcing it open, the arch will crush down upon
them, and they will almost all be annihilated beneath the
heavy stones, to the weight of which will be added that of
those which will cause the arches to give way."</p>

<p>"Bellido," exclaimed the count, filled with enthusiasm, and
extending his hand to the traitor, "I congratulate you, and
I am in thorough accord with your plan, which appears to me
to be an excellent one. What a joyous day it will be for me
when I succeed in exterminating that infernal band, which
is a perpetual nightmare to me! It is not two hundred
golden pieces that I will give you, but three hundred, as
soon as your scheme succeeds as well as we both hope it
shall."</p>

<p>"I can rely upon you to carry out exactly the instructions
which I have given you. You will not forget that the attack
is to take place on tomorrow night?"</p>

<p>"I shall not forget it, Bellido; nor shall I forget either
to have the three hundred gold pieces ready counted for you.
Take care not to enter the postern at the head of the band,
for it would be very ungrateful of me to wish you ill, when
you are serving me so well."</p>

<p>"You may be quite sure I shall not do so; I shall remain
outside, and if the door has not been closed after the bandits
enter, I shall take care to shut it and also to bolt it outside,
so that none of them may get out when the arched ceiling
is about to fall."</p>

<p>A short time after, Bellido Dolfos returned to the camp
of the bandits.</p>

<p>As soon as he had sent the traitor away, and when almost
all were asleep in the castle, Don Suero summoned one of his
servants, who acted as architect whenever repairs had to
be carried out in the castle, and gave him instructions as
to what was necessary to be done to the arched ceiling of the
chamber which was to serve as the sepulchre of the bandits.
During what remained of the night heavy hammering could
be heard in the direction of the postern, and before morning
everything was arranged as Bellido had ordered; the keystones
of the arch had been loosened, two enormous stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
had been suspended over it, by means of pulleys fastened
to the roof, and the postern had also been manipulated so
that it could be pushed open without much force, and afterwards
bolted outside.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the certainty which the count felt of
destroying the bandits by the ingenious plan which Bellido
had devised, he was very uneasy, when he reflected on the
insult which he had offered to Rodrigo Diaz by calling him
a coward, and he doubted not but that De Vivar would
endeavour to take revenge on him. All this weighed heavily
on the mind of the count, as he feared the serious consequences
which it might bring upon him.</p>

<p>He was thinking on this, when he was informed that four
cavaliers had arrived at the castle from Burgos, and that they
were the bearers of a message for him. The greatest fear
seized on Don Suero when he received that announcement,
and, as he did not at once reply to the servant who was
awaiting an answer, the latter ventured to say to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, what reply shall I bring to the messengers?"</p>

<p>"May hell swallow me!" exclaimed Don Suero, violently
stamping on the floor. "I should like to have the entire
human race in my power, to destroy it with my hands!"</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he sought for a dagger in his girdle, and
not finding it, he took up a stout piece of wood, which lay
amongst those beside the fireplace, and gave several blows
to the unlucky servant, who bore them resignedly, persuaded
that submission was best when the count was in a passion.</p>

<p>When he had treated his servant in this unjust manner,
he sat down beside the fireplace and remained for some
instants buried in thought; he then suddenly exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, I shall not fight with him; Martin Gonzalez was
stronger and more skilful than I.... Lucifer protects De
Vivar."</p>

<p>Having said this, he raised his head, and seeing the servant,
who was still patiently awaiting his orders, he added&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you still there, fellow?"</p>

<p>And he was about to take up again the piece of wood with
which he had belaboured his shoulders; suddenly, however,
abandoning his threatening attitude, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Gonzalo; I have beaten you, not knowing
what I was doing; introduce to my presence those cavaliers,
or whatever they are."</p>

<p>The servant obeyed, and a minute after Antolin Antolinez,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Alvar Fañez Minaya, and two other cavaliers, also of Burgos,
stood in the presence of Don Suero.</p>

<p>"To you, Don Suero Gonzalez, Count of Carrion," said
Antolin, "Don Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar sends us,&mdash;he whom
you insulted in Burgos, by calling him coward and low-born"&mdash;</p>

<p>Don Suero interrupted Antolin Antolinez, saying humbly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Certainly, I called him coward, not knowing that it was
he; for my anger, at seeing my servitors ill-treated, blinded
me."</p>

<p>"Don Suero, you must give this apology to the offended on
the field of battle, and not here," replied Antolinez.</p>

<p>"For two cavaliers to engage in deadly strife," answered
the count, still humbly, "it is necessary that they should
hate each other, and I have no rancour towards De Vivar, nor
do I consider him a coward or low-born; on the contrary
I acknowledge him to be one of the bravest and most
honourable cavaliers of Castile."</p>

<p>"If, then, you believe that," said Antolin Antolinez, "publish
it, and make it known in all parts. Thus only, except by
fighting face to face, can you satisfy the offended. The
honour of De Vivar is of such value that its master will
defend it with the greatest ardour."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that the humiliation, which you propose to
me, should be inflicted on a good cavalier, such as I am?"</p>

<p>"And do you believe that a good cavalier, such as Don
Rodrigo is, should be called a coward with impunity? No,
no, as God lives! If Rodrigo Diaz is not himself able to
avenge the insult which you have cast on him, there are a
thousand cavaliers in Castile ready to unsheath their swords in
defence of his honour. Listen, mean and calumnious count!
Don Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar challenges you to single combat,
and tells you that, if you do not accept the challenge, he will
put up notices all through Castile and Leon, denouncing your
villainy and cowardice to the execration of the public."</p>

<p>"Be silent, be silent! and do not force me to add fresh
insults to those which I addressed to De Vivar in Burgos,"
exclaimed Don Suero, abandoning the submissive tone which
he had hitherto used.</p>

<p>"In fine, what is your reply to him who has sent us?"</p>

<p>Don Suero stood up with haughty demeanour, and answered,
with supreme disdain&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell De Vivar,&mdash;tell him that he may do what suits him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
best; tell him that the Count of Carrion does not choose to
fight with so base a cavalier."</p>

<p>"We have delivered the message of Don Rodrigo, and we
shall carry back your reply to him," answered Antolin
Antolinez; and he and his companions immediately set out on
their return journey to Burgos.</p>

<p>They had scarcely left the castle when Don Suero began to
meditate on the reply which he had just given; he thought on
the stain of cowardice which would be cast on him, broke out
into furious imprecations, and maltreated in a barbarous way
the first servants who presented themselves to his sight. Very
soon, however, his rage changed into discouragement and
terror, and he wept like a weak woman. But the hope of
destroying the bandits on that very night roused up his
spirits, and, full of that subject, he ceased to think on the
challenge of Rodrigo.</p>

<p>Two days after, Rodrigo Diaz caused proclamations to be
posted up throughout Castile and Leon, publishing the
cowardice of Don Suero, and returning, with interest and the
greatest justice, the insults which he had received; two days
after, the Count of Carrion, who before was well hated by
some, was now abhorred by all; two days after, the country
people were singing the ballads which the troubadours had
composed, setting forth, in the blackest form, against Don
Suero, the question between him and De Vivar.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW ONE MOOR REMAINED, AND FIVE WENT AWAY</p></blockquote>


<p>Two days had passed from the time that Rodrigo entered
Burgos with the spoils which he had taken in the mountains of
Oca, and Teresa Nuña, Ximena, Lambra, and Mayor were
amusing themselves, talking to and caressing the Moorish
boy, saved by the kind-hearted Castilian general on the field of
battle. The boy was very handsome, and spoke the Romance
language with tolerable facility, as he had learned it from the
Christian captives who had always been servants in the house
of his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>Those kind women had received him well, as Fernan
prophesied, and lavished on him all the caresses which a
tender mother has for her children when she sees them sad
and disconsolate. The poor little fellow, who, notwithstanding
the kind manner in which Rodrigo treated him, had been sad
and downcast, now recovered courage and joyousness; and
even tears of gratitude and pleasure sprang from his beautiful
and expressive eyes. Lambra was almost mad with delight
on account of the handsome boy; the honoured and faithful
dueña, who had envied a thousand times the happiness of
mothers who had children to caress and to be caressed by,
saw in anticipation the joy she would experience when her
mistress and Rodrigo would be married, a joy which was her
golden dream, and which would consist in having children by
her side, to whom she could be, in a certain sense, a mother.
Even Mayor participated in the contentment of her mistress
and of the dueña, for without doubt she saw in that pretty
child what she hoped the fruit of her love for Fernan
would be.</p>

<p>The tender sympathy which binds children to women
certainly moves and consoles the soul, whether those women
are mothers or those who have never experienced the pains
and delights of maternity. A poor, unprotected child often
appeals in vain to the heart of a man, but never to that of a
woman. When, covered with rags, shivering with cold, and
famished with hunger, it appeals to public charity in the
streets, let us count the men and the women who aid it, and
we will see that the number of the former is very much less
than of the latter. What consoling words often escape in such
cases from a woman's lips!</p>

<p>"Have you no mother?"</p>

<p>"Poor little angel!"</p>

<p>"Alas for mothers who have given birth to children, to see
them thus!"</p>

<p>Such as these are the words which the lips of women
pronounce over the unhappy child.</p>

<p>Let us bring back our memory to the calm days of our
childhood, let us bring to mind what sex it was that dried our
tears, impressed kisses on our cheeks, lulled us to repose with
songs, watched over our sleep, took part in our games, divined
our wishes in order to satisfy them, wept when we were in
grief, and celebrated with deep contentment our good health
and joy. The name of a woman will be always bound up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
those recollections, whether it be that of our mother or of
some other. God, who foresees everything, who never entirely
abandons the weak, has given the child a mother in almost
every woman.</p>

<p>Let us wander through the streets, let us go into villages,
let us enter the dwellings of the wealthy, and then let us
pass on to the cottages of the poor&mdash;wherever God has not
given a vulgar and stony heart, we shall find the essence
of poetry and of sentiment in the multitude of names
with which, everywhere, women express their tenderness for
children.</p>

<p>"My love!" "My delight!" "My treasure!" "My glory!"
they exclaim, kissing with rapture the rosy cheek of
an angel. And those names, not studied, but rushing
spontaneously from the heart, are they not of more
value than all the loving expressions that poets have ever
invented?</p>

<p>The sentiments with which children inspire women raise
them above vulgar surroundings, and purify their souls with
the holy fire of poetry. When we see women filled with such
feelings, let us ask them why they love children, and they will
reply to us with these words, or similar ones&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because, when we seek for angels on earth, we can only
find them in these little children."</p>

<p>If for other qualities, for other virtues, for other attractions,
women do not merit the love and respect of all generous and
good souls, they deserve it for the sympathy which children
awaken in their hearts.</p>

<p>Let those be blessed and loved who understand and
experience the feeling which moved the lips of the divine
Nazarene when He said, "Suffer the little children to come
unto Me!"</p>

<p>"Ismael," said Ximena to the Moorish boy, "did you ever
know your mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, kind Christian; she was beautiful and good, and
loved me as you do; but Allah took her to Paradise just at
the end of the last Ramadan."</p>

<p>"Son of my soul!" exclaimed Teresa Nuña, "and did you
love her much?"</p>

<p>"Ah yes," replied the child, "and yet she did not take me
with her."</p>

<p>His eyes overflowed with tears, and he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"When holy Allah called her to Paradise, my father and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
wept very much. A short time after the king was enrolling
people for the war, and my father asked me, 'Would you
wish to go see your mother?' 'Oh yes,' I answered.
On that very day he took me up behind him on his horse, and
we set out for the frontiers of Castile. 'We are going to the
war, my son,' said my father to me, on the road; 'I trust that
we may be killed in it, for then we shall fly to Paradise, and
never again be separated from your mother, who is there.'"</p>

<p>The boy interrupted his story for a moment, bursting into
sobs, and then added&mdash;</p>

<p>"My father went to Paradise to see my mother, ... and he
too did not take me with him."</p>

<p>"Poor little fellow!" exclaimed the compassionate women,
who surrounded Ismael, caressing him and endeavouring to
console him, just as affected as he was.</p>

<p>"Unhappy child!" said Lambra; "what he wishes is to
return to his own country."</p>

<p>"Would you like to go back to your native country, my
son?" asked Teresa. "Do you wish to return to Molina?"</p>

<p>"My parents are not there now," answered the child in a
despairing tone. "I wish to remain with you, who are good
and loving like my mother."</p>

<p>"Well, then, remain with us; for we will love you, as your
mother did, my son."</p>

<p>"How good the Christians are, how good!" exclaimed the
child, not knowing how to show his gratitude to those who were
pitying and consoling him.</p>

<p>"And would you like to be a Christian?" asked Teresa Nuña.</p>

<p>"If you are to be my mothers, I will adore the Prophet
whom you adore. My mother used to say that children
should adore the God that their mother adored; and does not
the Nazarene, your Prophet, love children?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son; children are the principal objects of His love:
He delighted, when He was on earth, to converse with them,
He was angry with those who ill-treated them and prevented
them from going to Him, and He leaves the gates of heaven
always open for them."</p>

<p>"Oh, how good your Prophet is! I wish to adore the
Nazarene," exclaimed the child enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Teresa Nuña and Ximena then left him for a short time,
feeling sure that Lambra and Mayor would take good care of
him while they were away.</p>

<p>Soon after Fernan came in, whilst the two women were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
questioning the child respecting his country and parents, and
the boy was replying to them with visible emotion.</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub," exclaimed the squire, "they
are simply fools to torment this poor little chap by reminding
him of the good things he has lost, which is the saddest of
remembrances. That's the way women always understand
tenderness; they kiss just as cruelly as they bite. I will ask
my mistresses, Doña Teresa and Doña Ximena, to entrust the
training of this little Moor to me; he is worth all the Moors
in the world. They will soon see how I shall make him a
perfect horseman, and also able to give lance thrusts, which
will be worth a king's treasure."</p>

<p>The tone of Fernan was rough enough, and his words
severe; but the face and manners of the squire were stamped
with such frankness and goodness of heart, that Ismael, far
from being frightened, ran to meet him, and clasped his legs
affectionately with his little arms.</p>

<p>"May I turn Moor," said the soft-hearted squire, "if this
young chap isn't worth all the spoils we took in the Oca
mountains! Every time I think of it, I feel more inclined to
give that fool of an Alvar a good cudgelling for finding fault
with Don Rodrigo because he put this splendid little fellow
into a litter."</p>

<p>And Fernan took up Ismael in his herculean arms, and
kissed him with enthusiasm, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would give you a thousand kisses, only that I am
afraid of rasping your rosy cheeks with my beard; but I will
shave, and then I can kiss you as much as I like. Are you
fond of arms and horses, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" cried the child, jumping with joy. "Have you
arms and a horse?"</p>

<p>"Of course I have," answered the squire. "To-morrow
morning we will go to the stables, and there I will teach you
to ride, and to use a lance and sword. I swear by Beelzebub,
that when you grow up, you must come to the wars with Don
Rodrigo and me, and fight like Bernardo at Roncesvalles."</p>

<p>"Bring me to the stables now," said the child, "and show
me your horse and arms."</p>

<p>"You are very impatient, little chap. But I suppose I
must humour you; and your vivacity pleases me."</p>

<p>And thus speaking, Fernan took the little Moor by the hand,
who was jumping with pleasure and impatience to get to the
stables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't take the child away, Fernan," said Mayor, "for if
my mistresses ask for him, they will be annoyed with Lambra
and me for not having kept him with us."</p>

<p>And she went to take Ismael by the hand which was free,
in order to remove him from Fernan; the squire, however,
pushed her away, and disappeared with the boy, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"He will go wherever I please, and all the women in the
world shall not take him from me. By the soul of Beelzebub,
that is a nice way to train up children&mdash;keeping them always
tied to women's petticoats! That's the way hens bring up
their chickens&mdash;and they become hens."</p>

<p>When the squire and the boy arrived at the stables,
Fernan showed the horses to Ismael, who was insisting on
being put on the backs of all of them. At last, to satisfy the
child, Fernan mounted him on Overo, which he saddled, and
the animal, with a patience comparable to that of his master,
yielded to all the caprices of the child; sometimes quickening
his pace, sometimes going slowly, now turning to the right,
now to the left. They then went to the harness-room,
and Fernan prepared to give Ismael his first lesson in the
use of the lance. He made him mount, in a saddle placed on
an arm-stand, put into his hand, to serve as a lance, a stick a
few feet long, made a mark on a post in front, and fastened a
strong piece of cord to the front of the arm-stand; he then
gave him, as a shield, the cover of a tin vessel used for carrying
water to the horses, through the handle of which he put
his arm; when he had thus accoutred him, he lectured him on
the proper way of holding both offensive and defensive arms.
Then the good Fernan ordered him to prepare to charge, and
to keep his feet well in, so that they might not be hurt; the
boy did this, and the squire, taking hold of the cord, dragged
on, by means of it, the arm-stand and him who was mounted
on it, very quickly. The boy made his thrust too soon, and
did not strike the mark.</p>

<p>"I vow to Judas Iscariot," exclaimed Fernan, "that he will
spoil his best strokes by his impetuosity."</p>

<p>"My horse did not gallop fast enough," replied the child.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Fernan, "get ready for a second charge,
and take care not to miss your aim."</p>

<p>"You will see, you will see how I shall hit the mark this
time."</p>

<p>The little Moor got ready again, and Fernan pulled the cord
more rapidly than before; Ismael, however, made the thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
too soon, and went even farther from the mark than on the
first occasion.</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub," cried the squire, stamping
fiercely on the ground, "that would put holy Job himself out
of patience. He thinks, I suppose, that he will do better by
making his thrusts too soon."</p>

<p>"I won't charge any more now," said the boy, more vexed
by his own want of dexterity than by the annoyance of
Fernan. Then throwing away the tin cover and the stick, he
began to run back to the place from which the squire had
taken him.</p>

<p>"Come back, my son, come back," cried Fernan; but it
was in vain, for Ismael was already with Lambra and Mayor.</p>

<p>"Curses on my impatience!" exclaimed Fernan, giving
himself a cuff on the side of his head. "What else could the
poor little fellow do but run away from me, when I treated
him worse than a slave?"</p>

<p>He then went off in search of the little Moor, and shortly
afterwards they were playing together as if both were children.</p>

<p>Whilst Fernan was thus amusing himself with Ismael,
another scene, not less interesting, was being performed in a
large apartment, in which the De Vivar family usually
assembled. Rodrigo was relating to his parents and to his
wife the innumerable brave deeds of his soldiers at the battle
of Oca, remaining silent as to his own, for the noble
cavalier was as modest as he was valiant. He spoke also of
the bravery of the enemy, for he was so just and honourable
that he could not refrain from praising merit wherever it
might be found.</p>

<p>"The hostile army," he said, "was numerous; but there
were very many who fought for no other cause but that of
pillage, and it was those who first turned their backs on our
swords and lances. The Castilian troops fought with great
bravery; but the victory could not have been won so soon if
the enemy had had a few hundred men as brave as their leaders.
Those Moorish kings, whom I brought here as prisoners, in
order that they might do homage to my parents and to my
Ximena, for you are all worthy of it&mdash;those kings, I say, and
especially Abengalvon of Molina, fought as valiantly as the
most perfect cavaliers in the world."</p>

<p>"Oh, how unfortunate they are, and how worthy of being
well treated!" exclaimed at the same time both Teresa and
Ximena, whose souls were always inclined to compassion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"For that reason," said Rodrigo, "I have treated them not
as wretched captives, who are generally loaded with chains,
but as kings, to whom those who receive them in their houses
allot the best apartments, believing themselves honoured by
having them under their roof; for that reason I intend to
restore them to liberty this very day, if you, my parents, and
you, Ximena, approve of my resolve."</p>

<p>"Yes, Rodrigo, yes," exclaimed all, with pleased accents.
"Sad captives!" added Teresa. "In their own land they
have, most likely, wives, children, or parents who weep over
their absence, believing them dead or lost to them for
ever."</p>

<p>"My son," said old Diego, giving his trembling hand to
Rodrigo, and visibly affected, "your heart is worthy of a
cavalier; not in vain was I the author of your being, not in
vain does my blood run in your veins, not in vain are you
descended from the noblest race of Castile. Oh, if Lain
Calvo, your grandfather, could raise his noble head from the
sepulchre! During my long life I have constantly laboured
for the cause of Castile&mdash;to make it greater and better&mdash;for the
honour of our house, and for the triumph of the faith; and
God has amply recompensed me by giving me a son as good
as you are. My strength is failing, my breathing is becoming
difficult, my term of life is but short; but what is death to a
cavalier when he dies honoured, as I am, and when he leaves a
successor as good as you are? Restore to freedom at once
those royal captives; in the eyes of your father, and in the
eyes of all that are good, such an act of generosity will
be one of your best triumphs."</p>

<p>Yes, Diego was right; on that day Rodrigo achieved one of
his noblest triumphs, for to him, the most affectionate of sons
and the most loving of husbands, the greatest glory was the
words which he heard from his parents and from his wife, and
the pleasure which they experienced by his act.</p>

<p>"Dear parents and dear Ximena," he said, as moved as
they were, "let us go now to set the captives free. If they
wish to acknowledge themselves our vassals, let them do so,
but if not, they shall be equally free."</p>

<p>Rodrigo and his family then proceeded to the prison of the
Moorish kings. We have said to the prison, but the apartments
of Abengalvon and his companions did not deserve
such a name. They were situated in the ground floor of the
building, having an entrance into beautiful gardens, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
certainly in every respect suitable for kings. Rodrigo and his
family descended to them by a wide staircase, which placed in
communication the two habitable floors of which the building
consisted, and then requested permission of the Moors to be
permitted to present themselves to them. The royal captives
came forth to meet them with signs of respect and apprehension,
and were about to prostrate themselves before Rodrigo;
but he prevented them, with kind words, which filled the
hearts of the Moslems with confidence and gratitude.</p>

<p>"The chances of war," he said to them, "placed your
destinies in my hands, and for that reason it is my right to
dispose of you as I may wish. Do you acknowledge that
right?"</p>

<p>"We are your slaves," humbly answered Abengalvon, who
was more conversant than the others with the Castilian
language, and who was also the youngest of the five Moorish
kings, as he was only about five-and-twenty years of age.</p>

<p>"Well, then," continued Rodrigo, "you were my enemies
when I conquered you on the field of battle, but you fought
with valour, and you bear the title of kings; for these reasons
I treated you all, not as slaves, but as friends."</p>

<p>"Who would not be ambitious to be considered as such?"
exclaimed Abengalvon.</p>

<p>"My desire is to be your friend," said Rodrigo. "Know,"
he continued, "that I consider myself so good a subject,
that I love and revere all who bear the name of king, and I
should consider myself dishonoured if I retained kings as
prisoners, even though they are Moors, enemies of my faith
and of my country. Return, then, to your kingdoms, and be,
according as your hearts may dictate, my friends or my enemies.
I comply with what my heart, and the hearts of my parents
and wife, whom you see here, dictate to us."</p>

<p>"Oh, blessed Allah!" exclaimed the Moors, raising their
eyes, moist with tears, to heaven. "The prayers of our
children and wives have reached you and caused you to feel
compassion for love and misfortune. We shall sound the
praises, in the midst of our families, of the noble Christian
who to-day teaches us to be generous and good."</p>

<p>And Abengalvon continued, addressing Rodrigo&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, we shall not be your enemies; we desire to become
your vassals, as such to respect you and to pay you tribute,
and also to become your friends, in order to love you. Let us
kiss your hand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come to my arms, if you believe me worthy of yours!"
exclaimed Rodrigo, as much moved as the Moors were.</p>

<p>They embraced him, weeping with joy, as did also the
honoured old Diego Lainez, Teresa, and Ximena, who were
looking on the scene with much emotion, and whose hands
the Moors then kissed, manifesting that they felt honoured by
being allowed to do so.</p>

<p>"Mother!&mdash;Ximena!" said Rodrigo a moment after, "open
the gates of their prison for those who have been our captives,
but who, from this day, shall be our friends."</p>

<p>Teresa and Ximena then went to a door which gave egress
to the street, and pulled open the two wings of which it was
composed.</p>

<p>"The gate of your prison is open to you," said Rodrigo to
the Moors. "Return to your homes, bring consolation to
your wives and to your children, and may God be with you,
my friends! Outside you will find good steeds to carry you,
and squires who will accompany you as far as the frontier,
bearing my green standard, so that neither nobles nor peasants
shall dare to molest you."</p>

<p>"We are your vassals, and every year you shall receive
tribute from us," said Abengalvon.</p>

<p>He and his companions then left the palace of De Vivar,
their eyes dimmed with tears, and blessing Rodrigo, Diego,
Teresa, and Ximena with all the fervour of which their souls
were capable.</p>

<p class="center">HOW THE BAND OF THE VENGADOR ATTACKED THE CASTLE
OF CARRION</p></blockquote>


<p>The band was advancing towards Carrion just at nightfall, in
order to make the attack on it at the hour arranged by the
leaders, of which attempt Don Suero had received notice,
thanks to the treachery of Bellido.</p>

<p>The Castle of Carrion was built on an eminence near the
town, beside a road, named at that period the Atalaya Road of
Villasirga. Before arriving at it there was found a very thick
wood. The night was dark, and for that reason the band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
could reach that wood without being seen by the sentinels.
Martin and his captains, Bellido and Rui-Venablos, ordered a
halt to be made in it, with the object of preparing for the attack
without being perceived, even though the clouds might clear
away and the moon shine forth.</p>

<p>The bandits, all on foot, were provided with steel hatchets,
iron-shod clubs, and pikes, with which they might force an
entrance into the castle. Martin had given orders to all not
to strike down the count, Don Suero, as he wished to reserve
to himself the consummation of the vengeance which he so
ardently longed for; he wished to bury his dagger in the heart
of the murderer of his father. The band was divided into
two well-ordered companies; one was to rush on in order to
force open the postern of the castle, and whilst this operation
was being carried out, the other was to protect the attacking
body, discharging their arrows against the loopholes and
battlements of the fortress, in order that the crossbow-men
who guarded them might be wounded, or, not seeing their
opponents, might shoot at random. Rui-Venablos, who always
considered the most dangerous position the best, asked permission
to lead the attacking body, and Martin went with him.
Bellido, therefore, commanded the other company.</p>

<p>Thus arranged, the bandits issued forth from the wood, and
immediately the cry of alarm was given in the castle, and the
defenders hastened to the combat.</p>

<p>Some of the bandits fell to the ground, pierced by the first
arrows discharged from the fortress, and this circumstance
increased the courage of the band. As the obscurity was very
great, and as the ground behind the castle&mdash;that is, where the
postern was situated&mdash;was covered with bushes, Bellido succeeded
in separating himself from the men whom he was
commanding, and in hiding behind some shrubs, where he
remained until his companions all passed forward, discharging
a cloud of arrows against the castle. Rui-Venablos, Martin,
and their company at last succeeded in reaching the postern.
This was strengthened outside with iron plates, on which the
bandits began to deal terrible blows with their iron-covered
clubs. It was not necessary to continue to do this long, as
the door soon gave way, the bolts which kept it shut having,
seemingly, been broken. Then the entire band rushed in,
uttering fierce cries of fury and wild joy. It was, however,
found necessary to force another door in order to get from the
place where they were into the interior of the castle, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
door was even stronger than the outer one. Martin was
furious when he met this new obstacle, just as he believed
the moment had come to avenge himself on the count.</p>

<p>"Break it, burst open the door quickly!" he roared to those
who were provided with clubs.</p>

<p>Those then began to discharge furious blows on the door,
which did not yield in the least, for it was also well strengthened
with iron outside, and securely fastened inside with thick bolts
of the same metal. Impatience became a torture to the heart
of the Vengador, and, taking a club from the hands of one of
his men, he began to wield it with the strength of a giant
against the door. At that moment a fearful blow was heard
above the arched ceiling of the apartment in which they were,
a blow which made the entire edifice tremble, a blow so
terrible that it almost seemed as if the whole castle had
crumbled down above their heads. All the bandits uttered
a cry of terror, except Martin, who continued his assault on
the door, for he only heard the voice of vengeance, which was
commanding him to execute his on Don Suero, so terrible
that he might expiate by it the innumerable crimes which he
had committed.</p>

<p>"Out, out! the arch is falling!" cried all the bandits, precipitating
themselves, in fearful disorder, towards the outer
gate, for indeed the roof was yielding, the stones, as we know,
having been loosened under the blow of the enormous weight
which had fallen on them. At the same moment some person
outside fastened strongly the postern-gate; but just then the
second door yielded to the blows of Martin, and he, with
Rui-Venablos, and about fifty of their men, rushed into the
interior of the castle. The others tried to imitate them when
they found that the postern-gate was closed against them,
but they had not time, for the arched ceiling came down
with a fearful noise, crushing the unfortunate bandits beneath
its ruins. A satanic burst of laughter resounded then in the
upper part of the castle, and a countenance, on which was
depicted savage content, appeared, to gloat over that horrible
butchery, at the hole which had been made in the upper
floor, in order to suspend through it the heavy blocks of stone
which were to fall on the top of the arch beneath.</p>

<p>The laughter had issued from the mouth of Don Suero,
and his was the hellish countenance.</p>

<p>The count and the traitor, who had aided him in his work
of extermination, did not know that several of the bandits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
had escaped without injury, and that the second door had
yielded and given entrance to them. Soon, however, was
this fact made known to Don Suero by the cries and the
tumult which he heard in the principal apartments; cries and
tumult which seemed to approach the chamber in which he
was. Indeed, the Vengador, Rui-Venablos, and their followers,
and almost all the armed men who guarded the castle, were
fighting furiously in the corridors which led to the rooms
usually occupied by Don Suero. Then the most abject terror
took possession of the count, for he was as cowardly as he
was tyrannical, cruel, and heartless; and running to a secret
staircase, he descended into the vaults of the castle, and
escaped from them, by a private door, into the open country.</p>

<p>The fight between the bandits and the defenders of the
castle was bloody and obstinate. The latter, collected in
one of the corridors which led to the apartments in which
the De Carrion family resided, resisted the attack with valour
equal to that of the bandits. The Vengador and Rui-Venablos,
however, filled with fury on account of the destruction of their
comrades, and of the resistance offered to them, resolved to
make a final attempt, for they must either fight their way
onward or die. They rushed, therefore, on their opponents,
striking down all who barred the way, and their companions
followed their example. Many remained dead or wounded
in this bold attack; the others broke through the living wall
which their enemies opposed to them, and dashed on, like
hungry lions, to the apartments in which they expected to
meet their prey. As they did not find him there, they uttered
furious maledictions, which terrified even the soldiers who
were defending the castle; they, wounded and discouraged,
had dropped their weapons, and only hoped to find safety
in flight. The bandits, having examined the apartments of
the count, left them, believing that he had sought refuge in
some other room, and they soon found one with the door
locked. This was the chamber of Teresa. They tried to open
it, but as it did not yield, the Vengador dealt it a terrible
blow with his club, which caused it to fall in fragments on
the floor. A young lady, the Infanta Doña Teresa, was
standing in a corner, almost dead with terror, and before
her stood Guillen, sword in hand, ready to defend the
maiden.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried the page to the bandits. "Hold back, for
you shall only get near this lady when some of you have felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the edge of my sword, and when there will be no other shield
to defend my mistress but my dead body."</p>

<p>Martin and Rui-Venablos halted; their companions, however,
were about to rush on Guillen, but the Vengador
prevented them, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whichever of you advances a step to injure this young
man or this maiden will fall dead at my feet; we do not
desire to wreak our vengeance on a weak woman, or on him
who defends her."</p>

<p>At the same time a great outcry was heard from the direction
of the town. The Vengador looked through the window,
which we have already described, and by the light of the
moon, from which the clouds that had covered it had just
passed away, he saw a numerous body of men approaching
the castle. At the same time he heard the voice of Don
Suero, who, seeing light in the window, was crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Defend yourselves, my crossbow-men; succour is coming."</p>

<p>The count had gone to seek reinforcement in the town,
and his vassals hastened to give it, for he told them that Doña
Teresa's life was in danger. More than two hundred men,
of all ages, were advancing with him, armed with the weapons
that first came to hand. The bandits were worn out with
fatigue, and their number was reduced to little more than
twenty. The Vengador knew that the death of all was certain
if they did not at once leave the castle. If he had avenged
his father he would have thought little of dying, but as he
had not yet done so, life was precious to him.</p>

<p>"Let us escape," he cried, "or the count will succeed in
killing all of us, and our comrades shall never be avenged.
Do you hear those cries? Don Suero has managed to get
out of the castle, and he is now returning with such force
that his triumph is certain. Many of our comrades, who lie
wounded in the passages through which we have come, must
remain in his power, for we have not time to succour them
and bring them off with us. They will be sacrificed by the
barbarous count if we do not take hostages. We have this
maiden in our power, and Don Suero will respect the lives
of our comrades, in order that we may spare that of his sister."</p>

<p>"The sister of the Count of Carrion," said Guillen, continuing
in his threatening attitude, "shall not remain exposed
to your outrages whilst I am alive."</p>

<p>"I swear to you that she shall be respected," replied the
Vengador, "but I must take measures to save the lives of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
my comrades. Sheath your sword, and come with her and
with us, for if you seek to defend your mistress here you must
die, and she will have no one by her side to see that the
promise I make you will be kept."</p>

<p>Guillen felt that it was best to follow the advice of the
leader of the bandits; he felt that it was necessary that Teresa
should have someone by her to assist her if her strength
failed, to console her when she wept, to guard her whilst she
slept, to protect her if her honour was threatened. He therefore
sheathed the sword which he had drawn to defend her,
and, sustaining the feeble footsteps of his mistress, he went
off with the bandits.</p>

<p>They all left the castle and penetrated into the adjacent
wood, just as Don Suero and his vassals entered the fortress,
which had been the theatre of such sanguinary scenes. They
walked on for some hours by rough and deserted paths, for
the bandits, now too few in number to face the Salvadores,
feared to meet them. At last they halted in the thicket,
which but a few hours before the band had left, full of strength,
hope, and valour. During that fatiguing journey the strength
of the unhappy Teresa had failed entirely several times, and
Guillen was obliged to carry her for considerable distances
in his arms, his love giving him force to bear that precious
burden, in truth not so heavy as would have been almost
any other woman, for Teresa was worn away by sadness and
grief.</p>

<p>There still remained there the tents and the other things,
which had been left to the care of a few of the bandits who
had not been able to go with the others. The Vengador
allotted one of those tents to the sole use of Teresa and the
brave youth who accompanied her, and he and his comrades
lay down in the others, half-dead with fatigue and discouragement,
first having placed sentinels in the best positions for
such, as they feared that Don Suero's men might have followed
their tracks.</p>

<p>All the bandits were soon in a heavy sleep, except Martin
and Rui-Venablos, on whom fatigue and grief seemed to have
had an effect quite different from that which they exercised
on their companions.</p>

<p>"Ah, poor Bellido!" said the former, "he must have found
his tomb in the Castle of Carrion. We were fools not to
have followed his example; we desired to act as cavaliers,
forgetting that we were only bandits, and that we had to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
with one of the most depraved and pitiless wretches that
was ever born of woman. It is we who should have found
our deaths in the castle, and not our loyal and brave comrades
who have been the innocent victims of our stupidity. What
have we to do now? Only to lament over our error, and the
mishap of our companions."</p>

<p>"Anger of God!" exclaimed Rui-Venablos, irritated at the
discouragement of Martin. "Does the Vengador become
faint-hearted, and does he shed cowardly tears just when the
moment has arrived to work with more firmness, with more
bravery, and with less pity than ever? Can you avenge our
comrades with tears, which suit women well enough, but
which are quite out of place in a man; by killing the count
I have to avenge our comrades, and something more"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have to avenge our comrades, and something more
also, by reducing to ashes the Castle of Carrion and plunging
my dagger into the heart of the count," said Martin, excited
by the words of Rui-Venablos.</p>

<p>"Thus do I like to see my chief!" exclaimed Rui, filled
with savage joy.</p>

<p>"Do not call me by that name," said Martin, clasping the
hand of his companion. "Call me brother, for from this day
we shall begin to reorganise the band, and it shall have two
chiefs. To prove to you how burning is the vengeance which
consumes me, and how great is my friendship for you, I will
confide a secret to you. Know, then, that I did not join
the band of the Raposo in order to exercise the calling of
a bandit, and that I did not continue such a life or take
the name of the Vengador in order to avenge those who were
slaughtered with the Raposo, but to avenge my father, who
was vilely assassinated by the count."</p>

<p>Martin then related to Rui-Venablos all that had happened
as they were returning from the pilgrimage, when Beatrice was
carried off, adding&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have kept this secret from our comrades, in order that
they might not mistrust me, knowing that I was working for
an object different from theirs, and that I was only desirous of
avenging an offence solely connected with myself."</p>

<p>"For the same reason," said Rui-Venablos joyously, "I
have concealed the true cause of my rancour against Don
Suero. You must know, brother, that I also did not embrace
the life of a bandit through affection for it, for I always held a
more honourable position. I have been a soldier since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
down was on my lip, and I have always fought in defence
of the faith, of my native land, and of the oppressed; and
have never entered into the pay of any but honourable gentlemen.
Being in the service of Don Ordoño de Lara, an
unfortunate old man, quite blind, came to me one day and
said, 'For a long time I have sought a man of kindly heart
and with a strong arm, who might feel compassion for and
avenge a wretched father, whom the Count of Carrion has
deprived of his sight and of his honour.' He then related to
me, with tears capable of softening stones, how Don Suero
had carried off from him a daughter, who was his sole happiness
in this world, depriving him at the same time of his eyesight,
in order that he might not be able to find her or avenge
so horrible a crime.</p>

<p>"'I have been told,' he added, 'that your aid has never
been asked for in vain by those oppressed by the powerful,
and therefore I come to you full of confidence.'</p>

<p>"His words moved me; I pitied his grief and his misfortunes;
I was indignant at the baseness and cruelty of the
count, whom I already regarded as an enemy, on account
of other acts of a similar kind which had been related to me,
and I swore solemnly to the poor blind man to avenge his
wrongs. He then departed, full of satisfaction and of hope, to
seek his daily sustenance through the country by singing to
the accompaniment of his lute. When he had gone, I thought
over the best means of keeping my promise to him; I knew
that it would avail nothing to challenge Don Suero, as he
would treat such a proceeding with contempt, the challenger
being a poor and obscure soldier, and he one of the most
powerful grandees of Castile and Leon. Should I seek to
encounter him unexpectedly in some lonely place and force
him to fight with me? That also would be unavailing, as Don
Suero is always accompanied by armed men to defend him,
and my death would have been but a useless sacrifice. Allies
were necessary to me in order to attack the Castle of Carrion,
and put the count to death, and as, just then, I heard your
band talked of, it seemed to me that it would be the best
instrument for the revenge I longed for; I therefore went to
seek you, and I succeeded in gaining your confidence."</p>

<p>"Brother," said Martin, rejoiced at being able to call
by such a name a man who was actuated by feelings identical
with his own, and who would not have embraced the life of a
bandit merely to live by plunder, "similar sentiments ani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>mate
us; the goal for which we are striving is the same; our
strength and courage are equal, wherewith to confront the
difficulties which we may find in our way. Perhaps Bellido
would have brought the same ambition to the band if he had
been inspired by some noble sentiment."</p>

<p>"Comrade," said Rui-Venablos, "you are exceedingly
simple, and by no means a good observer, if you imagine that
any kind of noble sentiments are to be found in Bellido. He
is dead, and it is just as well that he is. I do not like to speak
badly of the dead, but nevertheless I say that he was very
far from being an honourable man. Did you never observe
his cruelty whenever we made an assault on a castle? Our
attacks were always directed against tyrannical and evil-living
grandees; was there not a vast difference between the way in
which you and I treated the conquered, and the way in which
Bellido treated them?"</p>

<p>"You are right, brother," replied Martin; "Bellido is dead,
and there is another person, who is in great grief here near us,
who is much more deserving of our compassion. I speak
to you of Doña Teresa, of that unfortunate young lady, whom
we have taken with us as a hostage. Her brother and she
have always occupied the reversed positions of St. Michael
and the devil: the devil held the angel beneath his feet. Yes,
the angel, for she is as good and pure as the angels in heaven.
That brave and faithful youth, who would not abandon her,
will watch over her; but we also must guard her; yes, we
must take good care of the innocent dove which has been
snatched from the talons of the hawk, and who, nevertheless,
weeps because she has been saved from them. Many of our
comrades are lying in Carrion, covered with wounds, and it
was but just that we should endeavour to save their lives, for
the facts of their having been wounded and having shared
our dangers are sufficient to make us pity them. We have
threatened the count that we will take the life of his sister if
he does not spare our comrades and give them their liberty,
but if he is barbarous enough to sacrifice them&mdash;even in that
case Doña Teresa shall return uninjured to Carrion."</p>

<p>"That is the very advice I intended to give you," said Rui-Venablos.
"If all men were as generous and good as you are,
the world would not be as it is. In what way, indeed, can
that poor girl be responsible for the crimes of her brother?
In the world, and especially in war, the just have often to
suffer on account of sinners, but we must not be guided by so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
cruel a law. Certainly, the bandit, when he requires food,
must take the bread of his neighbour, but there are plenty of
neighbours who well deserve to die of hunger. We shall take
the bread from them and leave it with good people."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Martin, "and in that way, even though we
are called by the name of bandits, our consciences will give us
another name; our consciences will tell us that, when we were
forced to choose between two bad roads, we took the better
one."</p>

<p>"Do you think, brother, that it is prudent to remain here?
We are too near Carrion, and Don Suero will endeavour to
take advantage of our weakness."</p>

<p>"We must only keep on the alert, and not change our
encampment for a safer one until those return who remained
alive in the castle."</p>

<p>The day was beginning to dawn. Martin and Rui-Venablos
knew that it was necessary to recruit their strength, worn out
by fatigue and the emotions of that sanguinary night; they
therefore stretched themselves on the ground, taking care that
their weapons were within reach. A few minutes after they
were sleeping soundly, and the silence which reigned in the
camp of the bandits was only interrupted by a few words,
mingled with sobs, which were heard from time to time in the
tent occupied by Teresa and Guillen.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">IN WHICH IT IS PROVED THAT COLD AND LOVE ARE NOT
INCOMPATIBLE</p></blockquote>


<p>The following night had arrived, and was somewhat advanced
when the bandits retired to sleep. The much diminished
band of the Vengador remained in the same encampment, and
Teresa and the page in the same tent.</p>

<p>The night was dark and cold, for it had rained during the
evening, and to the rain had succeeded a thick fog, with which
the day had ended. Teresa and Guillen were sitting near
some badly-burning pieces of wood, the heat of which could
not warm the page, for it was deadened by the dampness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the ground, and by the fog, which penetrated the canvas of
the tent, almost like an icy fluid.</p>

<p>Teresa was shivering with cold, and a deadly pallor overspread
her face; but a pink circle extended around her
sweet eyes, a sign that the unhappy girl had been weeping.
Tears also had come to the eyes of the youth, although he
had done his best to keep them in. Who would formerly
have said that the page, so manly, so brave, so joyous, would
one day mingle his tears with those of a weak girl? What
an affecting sight was that of the poor maiden, with a
body so frail and delicate, accustomed to all the comforts
of a castle, almost dying of cold and mental prostration,
seated on an icy stone, with her feet resting on the wet earth,
her clothes saturated with moisture, and with scarce strength
enough to approach her hands to the partially extinguished
fire; and then that kind-hearted youth, with the robust body,
with the brave soul, accustomed to arms, and to manly
exercises, trying to cheer her with his words, and cover her
with his clothes, timidly warming the hands of the maiden
between his own, reviving the fire which was going out, and,
after all, his eyes filled with tears, feeling that all his tenderness,
all his love, all his efforts, were unavailing to bring
comfort to that delicate girl.</p>

<p>"You are very cold, is it not so?" asked Guillen, with all
the tenderness, anxiety, and love with which a father could
question a dying daughter. "Oh! to see you dying of cold&mdash;I
who would wish to see you seated on a throne! Are you
very cold?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Guillen," answered the girl, shivering, "I am very
cold."</p>

<p>The page, who had already covered Teresa with his mantle,
took off a kind of jacket which he wore, and was about to put
it also on her.</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed Teresa, "I will not take your jacket;
you will die of cold."</p>

<p>"Have no fear for me," said the page, endeavouring to
smile pleasantly, "for I am strong, and accustomed to
hardships. If I should feel cold, I will put it on again as soon
as it has warmed you a little."</p>

<p>Teresa let him cover her with the jacket.</p>

<p>Guillen then considered how he could best keep up the fire.
But how could he do it? He did not know what was to be
done, but he felt that something must be done, one way or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
another, for the life of Teresa depended on the fire being
kept burning, and his own life also, for he neither hoped nor
desired to live if his lady died.</p>

<p>"I am going in search of wood; wait but a few moments,"
he said to her, and he went out of the tent, walking with
difficulty, for the cold was paralysing his limbs. He had
advanced a few steps, not knowing in what direction he was
going, when his foot struck against a solid body, not hard
enough to be either a stone or a block of wood. He examined
it with his fingers, and found that it was a saddle; with it he
returned, exceedingly rejoiced, to the tent.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, lady," he said on entering; "for I have brought
something with me that will make a fire warm enough to put
heat into a dead man."</p>

<p>"Oh, how kind you are, Guillen! You always come in
time to save me," exclaimed Teresa, with a weak and rather
startled voice,&mdash;the page, however, did not notice the latter.</p>

<p>He then broke the saddle in pieces; the leather with
which it was covered had prevented the rain from reaching
the straw and the wood of the framework. Thanks to the
former, Guillen was able to light a good fire, even though he
had to be economical with the fuel, for it was not plentiful,
and the night would be long.</p>

<p>The heat of the fire soon warmed Teresa, and a slight smile
began to appear on her lips, which Guillen looked on as the
return of life. If the joy that shone in the dark, full eyes of
the page could have been seen, one would have believed that
these moments were the happiest of his life.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Teresa, trying to smile, "if you but knew the
terror I was in, during the few minutes you were away from
the tent in search of wood."</p>

<p>"In terror&mdash;of whom, lady?"</p>

<p>"When you went this evening to the tent of the Vengador
a bandit approached ours, gazed on me with much attention,
and then went away, uttering some words, the meaning of
which I did not catch. Then, a moment before your return
with the fuel, I thought I saw again the face of the same man
over there, at the entrance of the tent; I was about to cry
out, but I heard your footsteps, and the face of the bandit
disappeared."</p>

<p>"Have no fear, lady," said the page in a pleasant voice,
"for the Vengador promised me that he would hang up on a
tree the first who tried to injure us, and besides, I have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
sword with which I would strike dead anyone who dared to
attempt such a thing. Be tranquil, lean against&mdash;But there is
nothing here on which you can rest your head," exclaimed
Guillen in a sad tone; and then he added, timid and stammering,
"Pardon me, lady&mdash;if you like&mdash;lean your head on my
shoulder."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Guillen," replied Teresa in a pleased tone of
voice; "I do not feel sleepy as yet, but when I do, I will rest
myself in the way you propose."</p>

<p>The page raised his hand to his eyes to brush away a tear,
and was near throwing himself on his knees before the young
lady to thank her for the happiness she promised him.</p>

<p>At the same moment a rough hand quickly raised the piece
of canvas which covered the entrance of the tent, and a
bandit, with a ferocious countenance and brutal manner,
entered. Teresa uttered a cry of terror, for she recognised
the face, which she had seen twice before. Guillen seized the
sword which lay unsheathed by his side, and asked the
bandit threateningly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you seek here?"</p>

<p>"Do you know, my gentle youth, that you are by no means
courteous to those who try to serve you?" answered the
bandit very calmly, and with an ironical smile.</p>

<p>"Go out of this tent at once," said the page to him.</p>

<p>"I have come to spend in it the remainder of the night."</p>

<p>"God's anger! Speak, for what are you come?"</p>

<p>"To relieve guard," replied the bandit, with his sinister
smile.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you."</p>

<p>"It is a very simple matter, my gentle youth; as you have
acted the sentinel so long a time to this maiden, or whatever
she is, I thought that you must be fatigued, and I have come
to relieve you for an hour or so."</p>

<p>"Be off, ruffian! be off at once, if you wish to leave the tent
alive!" exclaimed Guillen, preparing to make use of his sword;
but the bandit replied, still in the same calm tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall not do so, my gentle youth, for it pleases me to
act as guard over ladies, even though they may be thin and
pale, like her who is listening to us. You will see how the
colour will have returned to her face by the time you return."</p>

<p>"Treacherous ruffian!" cried Guillen, and he made a thrust
of his sword at the bandit, not being able to restrain his indignation;
but the fellow stepped rapidly back, and avoided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
stroke, then drawing his dagger, he continued, with agile leaps,
to avoid the sword strokes which Guillen aimed at him, until,
taking advantage of a false move which Guillen made, caused
by the dampness of the ground, he rushed on the page, and
succeeded in wounding him in the hand which held the sword.
Teresa uttered a piercing and dolorous cry on seeing Guillen
wounded by the bandit; but the page, far from losing his
courage on feeling the point of the dagger in his hand, rushed
violently on his opponent, and reached him twice with his
sword, wounding him slightly. A furious fight was just
commencing, when the Vengador and Rui-Venablos suddenly
entered the tent; the former seized the bandit by the neck
with the strength of a giant, and threw him out of the tent,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Traitor, you shall atone for your villainy with your life.
Do you imagine that this youth alone guarded the lady?"</p>

<p>The page then approached the young girl.</p>

<p>"You are wounded, Guillen!" she exclaimed, as soon as
her terror allowed her to open her lips.</p>

<p>"It is nothing, lady," replied the page, trying to conceal his
hand; "it is but a slight scratch, which I scarcely feel."</p>

<p>"No, no, Guillen; you must let me bind it with my
handkerchief. Oh, my life would be but a small thing with
which to repay your sacrifices for me!"</p>

<p>Then Teresa took hold of his arm and forced him to let her
bind the hand, which she did with her handkerchief, which was
wet with her tears.</p>

<p>The page blessed, in the depths of his heart, the dagger of
the bandit, which was the cause of his receiving such care
from Teresa, whose eyes were shedding tears for him, for the
humble servitor, whose blood no other mistress but Teresa
would have considered of any value.</p>

<p>"Guillen, Guillen, for how many sacrifices am I not your
debtor! how good, how generous you are!" exclaimed the
noble girl, raising her mild, moist eyes to the youth, with such
an expression of gratitude and love, that the page was overcome
with joy, and, not without much difficulty, he murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"You owe me nothing, lady; my life is worth less than the
least of the kindnesses which you have shown me."</p>

<p>"See, Guillen," interrupted Teresa, with an affectionate,
almost childlike tone of voice, "you must not call me lady,
for&mdash;I know not why&mdash;but I do not wish you to call me by
that name. How am I to be your lady, when you are my sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
protector, my saviour, my angel guardian? I cannot explain
it, Guillen, but I feel an immense void in my heart whenever
you call me by that name. For a long time I have recognised
in you, not a servant, but a loyal and loving friend, and now
even the name of friend seems to me cold and ungracious.
If the word 'brother' did not make me tremble, if it were not
so odious to me, I would call you by that name, Guillen, for
it would express the feelings which your affection, your unselfishness,
and your protection inspire in me. Ah, Guillen!
do not call me your lady, call me simply Teresa."</p>

<p>The page knelt down before her, overcome by gratitude, by
joy, and by love.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he said, "I will call you Teresa, I will call
you the holiest and the kindest of women! I also find it
necessary to call you by a name which expresses the feelings
of a heart full of gratitude, of happiness, and of"&mdash;</p>

<p>The page stopped suddenly, for the word "love" was about to
escape his lips, and who was he, to make a declaration of love
to her, the noble heiress of the countship of Carrion? A
poor page had little claims on the love of one of the noblest
ladies of Castile and Leon, simply for having amused her a
short time, now and then, with his conversation in the Castle
of Carrion; for having accompanied her to the camp of the
bandits, when she was carried off by them; for having spent
four-and-twenty hours in that tent near her, without even
having had the consolation of being able to protect her from
the rain and the cold; and for having shed a few drops of
blood in her defence. If such services deserved a recompense,
were they not amply rewarded by the kindness of Teresa, who
had carried that so far as to permit the humble page, the son
of a poor peasant, to treat her as her equal?</p>

<p>These considerations sealed the lips of Guillen, in order
that he might not reveal the intense love which burned in his
heart.</p>

<p>"Teresa," he said, after a moment of silence, desirous of
changing the subject of their conversation in order to conceal
his feelings, "it is now late, and you have need of sleep, even
for an hour or so; who knows but that we shall have to pass
all to-morrow in travelling to the mountains of Oca?"</p>

<p>"You are right, Guillen," she replied; "but you think only
of me, and not at all of yourself. Have you not also need of
rest?"</p>

<p>"I shall sleep at the same time as you, for we need now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
have no anxiety; you know that the leaders of the bandits
watch over us," said the page, sitting down beside the girl, so
that she might rest her head on his shoulder, as had been
arranged between them.</p>

<p>Teresa understood the intention of the page, and leant her
head on his shoulder.</p>

<p>What Guillen felt at that moment may be understood, but
it is difficult to explain it; it is not necessary, however, to do
so. We can comprehend it if we identify ourselves with him,
in his love and in his situation; we can comprehend it if we
have not souls of ice and hearts of stone; we can understand
it, best of all, if we have kept concealed for a long time in our
breasts a love, as pure as it was ardent, equally distant from
triumph and from despair.</p>

<p>Almost at once a deep and calm sleep fell upon Teresa, for
pure consciences and innocent souls find in the peace of their
night's sleep compensation for the cares and troubles of the
day.</p>

<p>Whilst Teresa slept, leaning her head on his shoulder, the
page would not have exchanged his happiness for that of the
most powerful of the Castilian counts; for that of Rodrigo
Diaz; for the crown of Don Fernando. To feel on his
shoulder the head of the maiden, to breathe her breath, to be
able to put his lips timidly on her hair, to feel the beatings of
her heart! Oh! the empire of the world would have been but
a small happiness for Guillen, compared with that which he
experienced during that short space of time.</p>

<p>The fire had nearly gone out, as the page had not been able
to feed it, fearful of awakening Teresa by making the slightest
movement. The chill of the morning, which was approaching,
at last aroused her. She, believing that Guillen was
asleep, removed her head very gently from his shoulder, but,
seeing that he was awake, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"O, Guillen, how peacefully I slept resting on you! I
dreamed that this tent was the cabin of the labourer, which
you pictured to me a few evenings ago, and that I was not the
Infanta of Carrion, but a poor and simple country girl."</p>

<p>"Ah! would to God that you were!" cried Guillen, full of
enthusiasm and scarce knowing what he said.</p>

<p>"But I remember that it is only a very short time since
you said you would like to see me on a throne," responded
Teresa, with an affectionate and pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, pardon me, lady&mdash;pardon me, Teresa, if my natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
rudeness has made me say a stupid thing," said Guillen. "I
only meant, that perchance you would be more happy if that
dream were a reality,&mdash;and I also would be more happy if
such were the case," he timidly added.</p>

<p>The love of the page was so great that his heart was
scarcely large enough to contain it. The life which Teresa
had reminded him of, that life, rich with peace and with love,
which he himself had sketched&mdash;sketched only, for although
he conceived it in all its beauty, he had not skill enough to
paint it in its completeness; that life, we repeat, presented
itself to his eyes, and the enamoured youth had not the power
to conceal his love any longer.</p>

<p>"And why, Guillen," asked Teresa, "why would you be
more happy if I were a poor peasant girl?"</p>

<p>"Because then I could always call you Teresa, and would
be at liberty to love you as no man ever loved in the world,"
replied the page enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Guillen!" said the Infanta in a voice trembling with joy
and emotion, whilst a glow of colour overspread her pale
cheeks, and her blue eyes shone with unusual brilliancy,
"Guillen! I have already told you, that for you I shall be only
Teresa."</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed the page, falling on his knees before
her, and raising his eyes, moist with tears. "I am the happiest
of men!"</p>

<p>He then added, looking up to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will love Teresa now, whilst I am but a poor
peasant, and the Infanta of Carrion, when I shall be worthy
of her."</p>

<p>"And why should you not love her now, Guillen? Is it a
crime for a man of humble birth to love the daughter of a
count?"</p>

<p>"It is not so in the sight of God, but it is so in the eyes of
men, Teresa," he answered.</p>

<p>"Well, then, let us do what God does not find fault with,
and let us treat with contempt the injustice and the false laws
of men. I, weak and cowardly until now, shall be strong and
courageous enough to resist all the efforts of him who should
be my protector, but who is my executioner."</p>

<p>"Oh, what happiness can be compared with mine!" exclaimed
Guillen, wild, mad, with joy. "I also, weak, and timid,
and humble until to-day, consider myself strong and daring,
and almost touching the clouds with my brow. Teresa, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
are my good angel; you fill my soul with noble ambitions,
you urge me on to all that is good and exalting."</p>

<p>"Guillen, I am no longer an unhappy woman; when I
despaired of meeting noble hearts in the world, I found one
in you, and loved it as the captive loves the hand that breaks
his chains."</p>

<p>The light of day was penetrating into the tent, the morning
was very cold, and the fire all but extinguished for want of fuel.
Guillen went forth from the tent, almost weeping with gladness,
and walked towards some trees which were near it. When he
got to them he raised his eyes to the branches of an oak, and
saw hanging from one of them the corpse of the bandit who, a
few hours before, had wounded his hand.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW TWO WOMEN DISCUSSED THE MAKING OF THEIR
FORTUNES&mdash;HOW TWO CHILDREN DIVERTED THEMSELVES&mdash;AND
HOW TWO MEN PLOTTED TREASON</p></blockquote>


<p>It would be difficult to describe the feelings of Don Suero,
and his rage, when he learned, on entering the castle with reinforcements,
which he considered quite sufficient to destroy the
bandits,&mdash;as he believed that but few were left alive after the
falling of the arched roof,&mdash;that they had fled, carrying Teresa
away with them. When he received this news regarding his
sister, he at once thought of Sancha, and anxiously asked what
had become of her. His retainers were not able to give him
this information, as the confusion and terror, which reigned in
the castle when the bandits abandoned it, had not permitted
them to see whether they had carried off any others with the
Infanta. He ran at once, filled with fear and uneasiness, to
the chamber which Sancha occupied in the lower floor of the
castle. The door was locked. Don Suero threw himself
violently against it, and as it did not yield, he cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sancha, Sancha! open the door; the bandits have fled."</p>

<p>Don Suero heard bolts drawn and articles of furniture pulled
away, which evidently had been placed there to strengthen the
door. It was then partially opened. Sancha stood there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
trembling, and pale as a corpse. The count uttered a cry of
joy on seeing her, and the girl threw herself into his arms,
murmuring with difficulty&mdash;</p>

<p>"O my lord, can I believe my eyes? Is it indeed true
that your life has not been taken by the daggers of the robbers;
that a life more precious to me than my own has been preserved
for me? During the fierce combat which has just taken place,
I put my ear to the keyhole to try to hear your voice. I heard
it at first, but then it ceased. I believed you were dead, and I
searched for a knife or some other weapon with which to
pierce my heart and breathe my last at the same time as you;
but I could find nothing; I had no means of ending my life.
The cries of 'Fire! the castle is on fire!' came at that moment
to my ears, and I felt quite sure that the Castle of Carrion was
about being reduced to ashes. I then bolted this door and
heaped up the furniture against it, in order that no one could
enter to save me from the flames, so that my ashes might be
mingled with yours."</p>

<p>Sancha had in reality fastened and barricaded her door in
order to protect herself against the fury of the bandits, and
terror had changed her appearance; but she had learned to
take advantage of all the different chances of life, and as an
excellent opportunity presented itself of adorning herself with
a fresh claim to the love of Don Suero, she profited by it.
She felt fully persuaded that the count loved her, and as, from
the first day she entered the Castle of Carrion, she had had
numerous opportunities of studying lovers' ways, she knew
that they are credulous in proportion to the love that dominates
and blinds them.</p>

<p>"The count," she had said to herself, "will believe me
madly in love with him, if I let him see that, without him, I
look upon life as of no value."</p>

<p>And Sancha had not deceived herself, for Don Suero interrupted
her, clasping her to his breast, and exclaiming in
passionate accents&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sancha! my own Sancha! How stupid I have often
been, doubting of your love! I will be your slave as long as
I live, and if death should snatch you from my side&mdash;then
Sancha, I shall cease to live also."</p>

<p>The girl abandoned the respectful tone and manners with
which she had received the count, hanging from his neck and
making use of her most winning caresses.</p>

<p>"O my love, my sweet charmer, my deity, my all! Should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
a day come when you would thrust me from your arms, cast
me from your heart,&mdash;then plunge your dagger in my breast,
and my death will not be so full of anguish."</p>

<p>"Throw you from my arms? Cast you from my heart?
Never, Sancha, never! Bonds unite us which not even death
can break."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the young woman in a sad tone of voice, and
as if suddenly all strength had left the arms which had clasped
the neck of Don Suero, she let them fall down, as if she were
overcome with fear. "The bonds of love unite us, it is true,
and they are the only ones which establish the union between
man and woman in private life; but can one always live shut
up in a castle, or in a miserable cabin? What men and women
are there who do not sometimes appear in public? To the
eyes of the vulgar it is only permitted to them to present
themselves in it with one name&mdash;with that of husband and
wife. There will be tournaments and other festivals to which
you must go; you will have to be present at the Court and
assist at its entertainments. Will you have me then at your
side, and will I be able to satisfy that desire, that imperious
necessity, of hearing constantly your voice, and of warming
myself in the fire of your eyes?"</p>

<p>Don Suero was fascinated by his love and by the words of
that cunning and ambitious peasant girl; not so much, however,
as to suddenly abandon his aristocratic feelings and his
pride of birth. For Don Suero, although one of the vilest of
men, believed himself to be one of the noblest cavaliers of
Spain, not considering that nobility of birth is valueless when
nobleness of heart is absent. Who was Sancha, that the Count
of Carrion could bestow his hand on her? The count asked
himself that question before replying to that of Sancha, and
thus, doubtless, he answered it: "She is an obscure peasant
girl; she is the daughter of a labourer, who has been well
cudgelled more than once by not only grandees like me, but
by miserable, beggarly hidalgos; she is the pupil of Mari-Perez;
she is a woman whom I love only for her beauty."
Yes, in that way the count must have answered himself, for he
replied to Sancha, with marked disdain&mdash;</p>

<p>"You hold the love of the noble Count of Carrion of so
little value that you ambition still more? Do you not consider
yourself sufficiently honoured and happy with him as you are?
Sancha, if you desire that my love should not change into
hatred, if you desire to be the mistress of my riches and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
my heart, if you desire, as you say, never to leave my side, be
content to remain as you now are."</p>

<p>"My ambition is satisfied with being as I am," answered the
girl; and she added, again throwing her arms round the neck
of the count, "Pardon me, my sweet love, for my affection
caused me to forget for the moment my humble extraction
and the honour which I owe to you. I asked of public opinion
what bonds were those which guaranteed to a woman the
fidelity of a man, and I was told that they were those of
marriage. My mind was confused by the joy of seeing you
uninjured at my side, and I was guided by the views of
ordinary people."</p>

<p>The count was calmed down by this apology. Sancha had
learned much at the side of Mari-Perez, and felt that she could
not then persist in urging her ambitious longings. The first
step had been taken; there was time enough to continue the
journey, and she would await an opportune time to do so.
Cunning and perseverance were necessary, for she was playing
for a very valuable stake&mdash;that of becoming Countess of
Carrion.</p>

<p>The next day an old woman in ragged garments approached
the castle. Her face was bandaged, as if it were wounded,
and she leaned on a staff, asking charity from the passers-by.
"That old woman," narrates the "Chronicle," "stopped under
the window of the girl's room, and, weeping bitterly, asked for
alms in the names of God and of the Holy Virgin; and when
the girl heard her she went to the window, and they spoke
for some time in secret." We, however, are more fully
informed than the writer of these lines, and know what they
were talking about.</p>

<p>The girl, indeed, went to the window, as soon as she heard
the voice of the old woman, and said to her in a low
voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"The count is mad in love with me."</p>

<p>"That is all right, my daughter," replied the old woman
joyfully; "if he loves you, and if you profit by my lessons, we
shall succeed in what we desire, and shall not have to live by
amusing hidalgos, who must be flattered and made much of
for their good looks. O my daughter, I was very uneasy
respecting what took place last night in the castle, until I
was informed in the town that the bandits only carried off
the Infanta."</p>

<p>"Go away, mother Mari-Perez, for if the count should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
recognise you and see you speaking to me, we might, perchance,
lose all we gained up to the present."</p>

<p>"I will do so, daughter," said Mari-Perez, for we now
know that it was she. "Please God, when I see you again
you will be the wife of Don Suero."</p>

<p>"I hope so, mother."</p>

<p>And the old woman walked off from the castle, commending
to God and all the saints the lady, from whom people
thought she had received bounteous alms.</p>

<p>Let us now return to Don Suero. The reader can calculate
how enamoured he was of Sancha, having seen him occupied
with her for some minutes, just at a time that was the least
suitable for love affairs. It is not easy to guess how long
he would have remained by the side of the peasant girl, if his
nephews, Diego and Fernando, had not arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>The two boys were looking for him in the vicinity of
Sancha's chamber, calling out his name in loud voices. Don
Suero heard them, and went out at once to meet them.</p>

<p>"O uncle," cried out Diego, on seeing him, "what a lot
of dead men there are down below and in the passages! If
you only knew how afraid we were when we heard the awful
uproar throughout the castle! Fernando and I were in bed,
and when some men came into our room we pretended to be
asleep. Tell us, is it true that they have taken off our aunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my children," answered Don Suero, as he liked the
boys very much, chiefly because he had noticed their evil
dispositions.</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," said Fernando, "for she was always
scolding us because we did not say our prayers, and because
we stuck pins in the dogs and cats, and cut off the hens' feet,
to see how they would walk lame."</p>

<p>Don Suero almost repented of his work, that is to say, of
the bad education which he had given to his nephews, when
he heard them speak in such a way of his sister, for he loved
Teresa, although his affection was of that barbarous and
tyrannical nature which tortures while it caresses.</p>

<p>"Be silent, and do not speak badly of your aunt," said the
count; "go back to your beds."</p>

<p>"We want to see first the dead and the wounded men,"
replied Diego. "If you were only to see all the blood that
is coming from their wounds, and the gestures they are
making."</p>

<p>"And I want to see them too," said Fernando.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Don Suero did not hear these cruel words of the children,
for he had hurriedly walked off towards the corridors where
the fight had been the hottest.</p>

<p>His vassals, the peasants who had come with him, were
busy in aiding the wounded of both sides.</p>

<p>"God's anger! what are you doing, fellows?" exclaimed
the count, seeing that his vassals were attending to the
wounded bandits. "Kill all those that belonged to that
cursed band; let that be your first care."</p>

<p>"My lord, do you know what you order?" was said to him
from all sides. "The Vengador has sent to tell us that the
Infanta Doña Teresa is held as a hostage for the lives and
liberty of all those of his band who are here, and that Guillen,
who would not leave your sister, will also answer for them
with his life."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Don Suero, almost howling with rage,
and stamping on the ground, "why does not the ground open
and swallow up the castle and all in it? The bandits shall
die, even though my sister dies also! My sister&mdash;poor
Teresa! No, no, care for them and bind their wounds, let
none of them die, for those ruffians&mdash;may God confound
them!&mdash;would kill my sister without pity."</p>

<p>The count then took precautions for the proper guarding
of the entrances into the castle, and sent off his vassals, except
a few whom he retained to keep watch on the ramparts with
the few crossbow-men who were still alive and uninjured after
the fight.</p>

<p>When the townspeople left the castle, Bellido Dolfos
entered it, and proceeded to the apartment of the count,
who was preparing to take some rest. He was covered with
blood, which was dropping from a wound in the front part of
his head; his face was pallid and disfigured, his voice was
feeble, and his legs bent under him at every step.</p>

<p>Bellido considered that he had a just right to treat Don
Suero with familiarity, considering the services he had rendered
him, and the pitiful condition in which he now was on
account of those services; he therefore entered the chamber
without any previous intimation, and before he was perceived
he threw himself down on an arm-chair. It creaked with
the weight of Bellido, and Don Suero then turned round,
and seeing a wounded man whom he did not recognise,
doubtless by reason of the blood which covered his countenance,
he stepped backwards and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"May Lucifer confound anyone who dares to enter my
chamber! Get out of this at once, fellow, whether you belong
to my men, or to the band of the accursed Vengador! It was
enough for me to give orders that the wounded should be
cared for, without having to attend to them myself."</p>

<p>"Don't you know me, count?" said Bellido in a weak voice.
"Don't you recognise your faithful servant, Bellido Dolfos?"</p>

<p>"Bellido!" exclaimed Don Suero, approaching the traitor
quickly. "You are wounded, you are losing your blood. How
did you get into such a state, tell me,&mdash;but no, it is necessary
first to staunch your wounds."</p>

<p>The count summoned his domestics, and at once sent for
one of the townsmen who practised the art of surgery, and
who then happened to be in the castle, lending his aid to the
wounded. A moment afterwards he arrived and bound up the
wounds.</p>

<p>Bellido, whose wounds were not dangerous, according to the
opinion of him who had attended to them, felt himself much
relieved, and he and the count remained alone in the room.</p>

<p>"I was very uneasy regarding you, as I knew nothing as to
what happened to you," said Don Suero. "I feared that some
misfortune had come upon you."</p>

<p>"What troubles me most," replied Bellido, "is that the
Vengador and Rui-Venablos have escaped from the trap we
set for them, and even got away, carrying prisoners with them."</p>

<p>"Now, leaving that for the present, tell me how you received
those wounds, and where you were from the time the attack
commenced until you came here."</p>

<p>"I shall tell you all in a few words, for my head is not in a
condition for much talking. I swear to you that I will go out
of my mind altogether, or else exterminate the Vengador and
his band. However, learn now how I received this cursed
wound. The entire band entered by the postern, and I remained
outside, having taken advantage of the darkness, of
the tumult, and of the bushes which surround that part of the
castle. When all were within, I approached the door, shut it,
and fastened it as well as I could, taking advantage of the nails
with large protruding heads, which are on its exterior, for the
purpose of resisting blows from outside. When the arch began
to bulge down just before falling, many of the bandits made a
rush to the door, trying to escape through it; I did my utmost
to keep it shut, using all my strength, but, notwithstanding,
the bandits pushed it forward against me; suddenly the arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
fell in, and doubtless the block of stone, which had occasioned
its fall, rolled towards the postern, and, striking violently against
it, dashed it outwards, and I received such a blow on my head
that I was thrown several feet away on the ground, deprived of
my senses; and know not how the nails did not split my head
open. When I regained consciousness, I found myself
covered with blood and in very great pain; I tried to rise, but
I fell again on the ground, and remained there for a long time,
until, making a fresh effort, I was able to come here, having
heard the bandits depart, and the townsmen return to their
homes, talking together as they went."</p>

<p>"You shall be well rewarded for all you have suffered in
serving me," said Don Suero, holding out his hand to Bellido.
"I promised you three hundred gold marks if the Vengador and
his band were destroyed, and I shall pay you the full amount.
If they were not all killed by the falling of the arched roof,
it was my fault, and not yours. But, as you know more of the
constitution of the band than I do, think you that the Vengador
will be able to get together again a band such as that
which he has now lost?"</p>

<p>"I swear to you that he will not be able to do so, nor even
keep with him the men that he now has," answered Bellido, in
so confident a tone of voice that the count was agreeably
surprised.</p>

<p>"And who will conquer him, when the brotherhood of the
Salvadores, in whom all the grandees of the country have such
confidence, has not succeeded, and probably will never succeed,
in suppressing the bandits?"</p>

<p>"I alone."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you think that Bellido Dolfos will be discouraged
because he stumbles at the beginning of a journey? Do you
believe that it is the gold from your coffers that urges him to
make short work of the Vengador and his band? If you so
think, and so believe, you know me but little, count. In souls
like mine there is no place for discouragement, nor for the
forgetting of insults. The Vengador and Rui-Venablos dared
to call me traitor and to point their daggers at my breast. I
would lose a hundred lives rather than relinquish the chastisement
of such audacity."</p>

<p>"You are wounded and weak from loss of blood. It will be
some time before you can attack the Vengador; meanwhile,
he will have time to reorganise his band."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>"The wound which I have received will favour my projects."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, Bellido."</p>

<p>"It is easy to understand me, my lord count. As soon as
I can travel, which will be in a few days, I shall set out to
rejoin the Vengador. The bandits will believe that I received
the wound when the arch fell in, and I will tell them that I
had a miraculous escape. I will relate to them a long story of
the sufferings which I went through before I could get back to
them, and if formerly they simply looked on me as a member
of the band, they will in the future not alone consider me as
such, but also as one who became a victim through my devotion
to it, and through the cruelty of the Count of Carrion.
At this moment I cannot tell you exactly to what plans I must
resort in order to win the full confidence of the Vengador and
his men, because my head is not capable of thinking them out,
but you shall know them soon, and your desires and mine shall
be fulfilled."</p>

<p>"Bellido, you are my best friend," said the count, again extending
his hand to the traitor. "All the gold in the world
would not be too much to reward your skill and the services
which you are rendering me."</p>

<p>He then opened a strong chest and took money from it,
which he handed to Bellido, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here are the three hundred marks, which you have so
well earned."</p>

<p>The eyes of Bellido shone as brightly as the gold which
the count had placed in his hand.</p>

<p>"Look there," added Don Suero, pointing to the interior
of the chest, which certainly contained a treasure; "see how
much gold I have, wherewith to reward your services, should
we succeed in exterminating the bandits."</p>

<p>The eyes of Bellido shone like burning coals, and seemed
as if they wished to attract the gold, which they devoured,
as the magnet attracts iron.</p>

<p>"You will return to the camp of the bandits," said Don
Suero, "as soon as you are able, and&mdash;count on my gratitude.
My sister is there, and I fear that they will take base advantage
of her weakness. Watch over her, Bellido, for the noble
family of the lords of Carrion must not have a fresh crime
committed by the band of the Vengador to lament over."</p>

<p>"Trust in me," replied Bellido. "Permit me now to
retire and seek some repose amid the wounded bandits, so
that I may be still thought one of them, and then watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
them, should you intend to set them free to rejoin their
companions when they are strong enough to do so."</p>

<p>"Such is my intention," said Don Suero, "and the sooner
the better, for the Vengador will not give freedom to my
sister until every man of his who is alive returns to him."</p>

<p>"You will often hear me protest against your bad treatment
of the wounded, and even threaten you with the vengeance
of the band. Pretend that what I do angers you, but bear
with me, for all will turn out to your advantage."</p>

<p>"I shall do as you desire, Bellido."</p>

<p>Don Suero and Bellido Dolfos then separated, both content;
the former with fresh hopes of destroying the bandits,
and the latter confident of revenging himself and, at the same
time, of making the count more and more his debtor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">WHAT HAPPENED TO RODRIGO ON THE ROAD TO
COMPOSTELA</p></blockquote>


<p>There could be seen in the palace of the lords of Vivar,
at Burgos, great commotion amongst knights, squires, and
pages, as if preparations were being made for a journey which
was to immediately commence. At the gate of the palace
stood several horses fully caparisoned, the number of which
was increasing every moment, according as fresh cavaliers
arrived, dismounted, and proceeded into the apartments
occupied by the noble family. Amongst the squires, who
held the horses by their bridles, were Fernan and Alvar, who
was trying to keep Babieca quiet, as his prancing and neighing
were throwing the other horses into confusion. That noble
animal seemed quite excited by the preparations for a campaign
which were going on around him. He was no longer the poor-looking
hack which Rodrigo had selected in the stables of
Don Peyre, and which excited the laughter of the passers-by.
His body had filled up, his coat had changed and acquired
gloss, he carried his head well and bravely, and his entire
appearance and movements were noble and free.</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub," Fernan was saying, "this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Babieca thinks that he will be soon in close quarters with
the Moors, and he can't contain his delight. My lord and
master is fortunate in everything. If the son of my mother
had a horse like that, he would not exchange it for the steed
of a king. And," he added, passing his hand over the sides
of the intelligent animal, "my good Babieca, what you eat
puts a shine on you. If you were mine it is not oats you
would get, but the best bread."</p>

<p>Overo, which was also there, brilliantly caparisoned,
approached his head to Fernan, rubbing it against him, as
if jealous of the praises which were being lavished on Babieca.
The squire turned towards him, stroking him also with his
hand, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hola, Overo! are you jealous, my son? If you were
as brave as Babieca, I would caress and reward you in fine
style. But do not let my praises of Babieca trouble you, for
your well-filled sides witness that I treat you well. You are not
very spirited, indeed; but everyone is as God made him, and
it is not just to punish failings which come to one from his
mother. Here are our masters, who treat Alvar as the very
best of their servants, and for all that he has not even as
much spunk in him as you have, Overo."</p>

<p>"By my soul, Fernan!" cried Alvar in a passion, "you
must give up comparisons of that kind."</p>

<p>"If you only were braver, I would compare you to Babieca."</p>

<p>"It is my misfortune that this knave of a squire is always
making fun of me!" muttered Alvar, still very angry, but
fearing to irritate Fernan. "I wonder why you show such
enmity towards me for some time back," he added, turning
towards him. "Have I offended you in any way, Fernan?"</p>

<p>"And you dare ask me such a question, when the reins of
Overo answered a similar one on your ribs yesterday? I
swear to you, Alvar, by the soul of Beelzebub, that I will
break every bone in your body if you don't treat the Moorish
boy like the son of a prince."</p>

<p>"I certainly do scold him sometimes, but it is because his
pranks, which you laugh at and applaud, irritate me."</p>

<p>"I applaud them because sprightliness in children should
be applauded. Ismael, or rather Gil, for our masters have
given him that name, is a little turbulent; but for that very
reason I believe that he will grow up to be a brave youth,
and a skilful and daring warrior. I have given him only
about a dozen lessons in horsemanship and the use of arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and he is now, as God hears me, almost as expert in such
things as I am myself."</p>

<p>The squire and the page had got thus far in their conversation
when they had to interrupt it, as they heard the cavaliers
coming.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Diaz was indeed about to undertake a long journey,
and his cousins and several knights of Burgos, who considered
it a great honour to be permitted to do so, were to accompany
him. He was going to Compostela, to visit the shrine of
the apostle St. James, for the purpose of returning thanks
to him for the victory of the mountains of Oca, and also to
comply with the custom, which every good knight practised
at least once in his life, of prostrating himself before the
holy patron of Spain, on whose aid he counted in all his
warlike deeds. At the same time Rodrigo desired to pay
a visit to the king, Don Fernando, who at that time was
personally superintending the reconstruction of Zamora, from
whence he had sent him letters, congratulating him on the
victory of Oca, and expressing an earnest desire to see him.
Zamora the Beautiful, as our romance-writers call it, had
been destroyed by the Moors in the time of Don Bermudo
III., the last King of Leon, whom Don Fernando had defeated
in a battle fought on the banks of the river Carrion, in which
Don Bermudo lost his life; after this the King of Castile
had joined the two crowns. Don Fernando had the intention
of leaving it to his daughter Urraca as a legacy, and for that
reason he was assisting in person at its reconstruction, endeavouring
with much trouble to make the jewel, which he
was preparing for his daughter, worthy of her who was to be
the possessor of it.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Diaz, with the cavaliers, squires, and pages of his
escort, mounted their steeds at the gate of the palace, and
waving adieu to those who came to the windows to bid them
farewell, they quitted Burgos and took the road to Zamora, all
in excellent spirits, although Rodrigo felt that he was almost
leaving his soul behind when he parted from Ximena and his
parents. Fernan also felt rather sad on leaving Mayor, whom
he had sworn would henceforth be his only love, even if there
were wars, in which so many men should be killed, that there
would be fully four women left for each of those who survived.</p>

<p>The name of Rodrigo Diaz resounded through all parts of
the country; the son of the grandee of Vivar was an object of
love and admiration to both Castilians and Leonese, for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
brave deeds had reached the ears of all. For this reason,
wherever he passed, the people crowded out to welcome him;
and in the plains, where he halted to spend the night, there
was warm rivalry as to who should have the honour of entertaining
him in his house. This was naturally very pleasing to
Rodrigo, but, in order to give offence to none, he arranged
that he, and those who accompanied, should lodge in the
public hostelries which were not wanting on that route.</p>

<p>The night was somewhat advanced when they came near to
Medina de Riosico; it had rained so heavily during the day
that the roads were almost impassable; it was, moreover, very
cold, and the darkness was complete. Our cavaliers were
crossing an extensive morass, when they thought they heard
very doleful moans issuing from a thicket, which lay at the side
of the road, and when they stopped their horses, in order to
hear better, a weak voice became audible, which said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Help me, travellers, whoever you are; if not, I shall die
in this thicket! Alas! I have lost my sight, and I cannot
save myself with my feet and hands."</p>

<p>"Be not uneasy," replied Rodrigo in a loud voice; "you
shall be succoured without delay." He then continued,
addressing his companions: "It must be some unfortunate
mendicant who has lost his way in the darkness and amongst
the thick bushes which grow hereabout. Let us seek him out
and bring him with us to Medina, which is near here, and
where we are to halt for the night."</p>

<p>He then guided Babieca towards the spot from whence the
groans proceeded, but the ground was so cut up, and the
thicket so dense, that the horses were scarcely able to advance
a dozen paces. Rodrigo therefore dismounted, and, giving the
reins of Babieca to Fernan, advanced so rapidly into the
thicket, that none of his companions were able to follow him.
Guided by the voice of him who had lost his way, he came to
where he was, and found an old man stretched on the ground,
covered with mud, soaked with water, and his limbs
paralysed by the cold, as well as by some nervous affection he
had in them. He raised him from the ground, filled with compassion,
and endeavoured to encourage and console him.
When he asked him how he got into such a place, the old man
replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"I lost my way in the evening, and tried for a long time to
find it again, but without success, for the more I moved about
in this thicket, the more did I become perplexed, until, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
strength having become exhausted, and my body benumbed
with cold, I fell in the place where you found me. In vain
did I call out for aid to those who passed by, but they either
did not hear me, or did not want to give themselves trouble.
I had then resigned myself to die, and become the food of the
wild animals which frequent this thicket, when I heard you,
and summoned up sufficient strength to call out. God will
protect him who raised up the weak, and guided the blind!"</p>

<p>Rodrigo endeavoured to get the unfortunate man to walk
out of the morass, but he was soon convinced that he could
not move a step, and then, finding more strength in his kindly
heart than even in his shoulders, he took him up on them,
and, although he met with many obstacles, got back to the
road, which he had left, in a very short time. The old man
wept with gratitude and joy. Fernan wished to put him on his
horse, and walk by its side to Medina, for he did not consider
Overo strong enough to carry a double burden, especially as
the road was so very bad. Rodrigo, however, did not wish to
share the credit of saving the unfortunate old man.</p>

<p>"Babieca," he said, "is well able to carry two men, not
alone to Medina, but even the entire distance to Zamora. You
will see how easily and bravely he will continue his journey."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Rodrigo mounted Babieca, and, with the
assistance of Fernan, got up the old man on the saddle behind
him. They all proceeded then towards Medina, where they
arrived half an hour afterwards.</p>

<p>The table was ready laid, and knights and squires prepared
for their supper. Rodrigo made the old man sit down beside
him, to eat with them, notwithstanding that this determination
displeased the other cavaliers, whom the dirt and the wounds
of the mendicant disgusted. The supper, however, began, and
as the hands of the old man were palsied, he let fall the food
when carrying it to his mouth, which only moved Rodrigo
to compassion for him. The other cavaliers could scarcely
eat their meal on account of the repugnance which the old
man caused them, and at last arose from the table, saying that
they could not bear the sight any longer. Rodrigo rebuked
them sharply, and obliged the mendicant to remain at the
table in order to finish his supper, although he was desirous of
leaving the room, so as not to trouble the companions of his
generous benefactor.</p>

<p>When the supper was ended; when the blind man had
somewhat recovered his strength; when the heat of the hearth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
had taken the numbness from his limbs; when his heart, in
fine, had been consoled by the kindness of Rodrigo, the
young cavalier began to talk familiarly to that unfortunate
man, and by degrees the other cavaliers, who had gone to sup
in another apartment, returned, desirous of hearing the stories
which doubtless the blind man would relate.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir knight," he then said to Rodrigo, "how much would I
rejoice to be able to repay your kindness! But what remains
to me in this world? Nothing but a sad heart to express its
gratitude,&mdash;and this instrument, with which I earn a poor
subsistence," he added, pointing to his lute.</p>

<p>One of the nephews of Rodrigo&mdash;the youngest and most
cheerful of them&mdash;said, on hearing these words&mdash;</p>

<p>"If it will be pleasing to you, my uncle and lord, and to
himself also, this old man can amuse us for a while by singing
to the accompaniment of his lute some of the ballads which
he doubtless knows."</p>

<p>"I shall do so with very great pleasure," answered the blind
man.</p>

<p>And as he felt that Rodrigo was not opposed to the proposal,
he took up his lute and began to touch its strings with
considerable skill and lightness, notwithstanding the palsy
with which he was afflicted. He then suddenly stopped and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Listen, cavaliers and squires, listen to the true story of a
peasant from whom a traitor count stole his daughter, in order
to dishonour her, and whose eyes he put out in order that he
might not be able to avenge himself."</p>

<p>He then sang, with the accompaniment of his lute&mdash;</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"Cavaliers of Leon,<br />
Castilian cavaliers!<br />
Haughty with the strong,<br />
But gentle with the weak!<br />
Through Leon and Castilian lands,<br />
Wanders a poor old man,<br />
A count's foul crimes denouncing&mdash;<br />
For a vile wretch is that count.<br />
He cannot take revenge himself,<br />
For age his body bends,<br />
And his eyes now only serve<br />
To weep o'er his sad fate.<br />
Come to the aid of that old man,<br />
In his most wretched plight,&mdash;<br />
Cavaliers of Leon,<br />
Castilian cavaliers!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span><br />
That vile count stole his daughter,&mdash;<br />
She was fair as a May rose,&mdash;<br />
And put him in a prison dark,<br />
Where the tyrant then did blind<br />
That sad, ill-fated, wretched man.<br />
Who will dry his constant tears?<br />
Who will give him back his child?<br />
Cavaliers, if such ye are,<br />
Punish that accursed count,&mdash;<br />
Him who bears off maidens fair,<br />
Him who vilely blinds old men.<br />
Such is the duty of the good,<br />
Such is the mission of the great<br />
Cavaliers of Leon,<br />
Castilian cavaliers!"<br />
</p>

</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The old man ceased his song, for he became almost
suffocated with sobs and tears. Those who had been listening
to him were also much moved, and their indignation was
so great against the count, who had been alluded to, although
they did not know who he was, that if he appeared in their
presence at that moment, they would have rushed at him with
their naked swords.</p>

<p>"Do you tell us that your story is true?" asked Rodrigo.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is true, sir knight, unfortunately for me," he replied.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for you? As I hope to be saved," exclaimed
Rodrigo, remembering the adventure which Beatrice
had related to him and to Fernan, "that count is the Count
of Carrion, and you are the old man whose daughter was
stolen!"</p>

<p>"You are quite right, sir knight."</p>

<p>"I vow by Judas Iscariot, that I would willingly give ten
years of my life to be able to put ten inches of my sword into
the breast of that felon count!" exclaimed Fernan, giving vent
to his indignation, which he could not restrain, although he
knew it was contrary to his duty to interrupt the conversation
of his master.</p>

<p>"And you know nothing of your daughter?" asked Rodrigo
of the blind man.</p>

<p>"I do not know, sir knight, what has become of her, but I
suppose the count keeps her shut up in his castle, for, if not,
she would have endeavoured to find her unfortunate father,
whom she loved so much, and loves still if she is alive."</p>

<p>The poor old man, as we see, was far from suspecting how
different his daughter had become since the count had deprived
her of her robe of innocence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"And have you found no cavalier to take upon himself
the carrying out of the revenge which you desire?" asked
Rodrigo.</p>

<p>"I have found," replied the old man, "a soldier, as brave
as he is kind-hearted; but up to the present he has not been
able to do anything."</p>

<p>"Then we will assist him in his task, and, as God lives, it
shall not avail the count to shut himself up in his castle and
lend a deaf ear to every challenge, as is his custom," said
Rodrigo.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" exclaimed all present; "we must punish that
accursed count, who is a disgrace to the nobility of Leon
and Castile."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the unfortunate old man, filled with joy,
"God will assist you in your noble enterprise. My journey to
Medina has not been in vain, for if I have not met the valiant
and noble cavalier whom I was in search of, I have found
another, not less kind-hearted and compassionate."</p>

<p>"Who was the cavalier whom you were seeking?" asked
Rodrigo.</p>

<p>"Don Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, he who was expected to
lodge here to-night," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then you find here him you were in search of."</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed the old man, scarcely able to speak,
such was his surprise, kissing the hand which Rodrigo held
out to him. "Can it be possible that he who carried me
on his shoulders, and seated me at his table, is Don Rodrigo
Diaz de Vivar, the conqueror in the mountains of Oca, the son
of Diego Lainez, the descendant of the Judges of Castile, the
most noble, honoured, powerful, and brave cavalier of Spain?"</p>

<p>"Rodrigo Diaz is he who took you on his shoulders, seated
you at his table, and intends to share his bed with you,"
replied the son of Diego Lainez.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord," cried the old man, not knowing how to
express his gratitude, "your kindness to me has been too
great; but to share your bed with me, a beggar, full of misery
and dirt! No, no, that cannot be, my lord."</p>

<p>"You say that I am noble, honoured, and powerful. Who
but the powerful, the honoured, and the noble should console
and protect the afflicted, the sad, and the defenceless? Let us
go to rest, for we all stand much in need of it, and particularly
you, a feeble old man."</p>

<p>Rodrigo, his companions, and the blind man then retired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and in reality the former did share his bed with the
mendicant. Divine rays of charity which would have adorned
the noble brow of the cavalier with the aureole of the saints,
if his brave deeds had not adorned it with the laurel crown of
the hero; for charity modestly hides herself, whilst warlike
heroism cannot do so.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the gratitude of the unhappy
old man when, the following morning, he parted from the
compassionate cavalier. It is impossible also to describe the
inspired accents in which, shedding abundant tears, he said to
Rodrigo&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, I feel confident that God has sent me to you to
bring you glad tidings. You are loved by Him; you will
conquer in all your battles; your honours and your prosperity
will increase; you will be feared by the bad and loved by the
good, and you will die happy, blessed by God and by men."</p>

<p>Rodrigo looked on these words as a divine prophecy. The
accents in which they were pronounced made him believe that
it was such.</p>

<p>At the rising of the sun, that bright and beautiful sun which
follows a storm, Rodrigo and his companions departed from
Medina de Rioseco, with the intention of reaching Zamora on
that day; which they succeeded in doing.</p>

<p>Here, where but a short time before could be seen heaps of
rubbish, between which nettles and brambles grew and reptiles
hissed, where it might have been said, "Here was Zamora,"
using the expression applied in old times to the city of Æneas&mdash;here,
we repeat, were springing up magnificent temples with
high turrets, superb palaces, and strong fortifications; and
bustle and animation had succeeded to the silence and solitude
which had but recently reigned there.</p>

<p>The king, Don Fernando, was just going to dinner when he
was informed that Rodrigo had arrived in the city. The joy
of the wise and good monarch was very great; Don Fernando
did not look upon the cavalier, whom he was about to see, as
a vassal, but as the most beloved of his friends&mdash;even more
than that, as one of his sons. Even the circumstance of being
separated from his family, which had remained in Burgos and
was so dear to him, had caused him to desire with greater
eagerness the arrival of Rodrigo, for he had now passed a
considerable time without being able to expand his heart in
the calm pleasures of family life. He therefore longed to
have at his side one, with whom he could feel himself joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
by closer and softer bonds than those which usually unite the
lord to his vassal, in order that he might satisfy the most
imperious necessity of his soul, that of living in the bosom of
friendship. He had scarcely learned that Rodrigo had
crossed the threshold of the palace when he went to meet
him, like a father who goes out to meet a son after a long
absence from the paternal dwelling. The brave and noble
cavalier was about to prostrate himself at the feet of the king,
like a good vassal as he was, but Don Fernando did not allow
him to do so, for he opened his arms and pressed him in
them, with an effusion of affection and esteem almost paternal,
saying to him, "You are very welcome, Rodrigo, glory of
Castile and strongest pillar of my throne."</p>

<p>"Oh, sire," exclaimed Rodrigo, much moved by so flattering
a reception, "the strongest pillars of your throne are your own
wisdom, your goodness, and the affection which your subjects
feel for you. I am one of them, and I would not change my
condition for yours, for the honours you confer on me are of
more value in my eyes than a throne."</p>

<p>"I love you, Rodrigo, as the best of my vassals, and I repay
but poorly all your services to me. I do not alone admire
and respect you as the descendant of Lain Calvo, as the son
of Diego Lainez, as the valiant youth who knew how to avenge
the insult inflicted on his honour, as he who conquered the
bravest of the Aragonian knights, and finally, as the hero who
gained one of the most glorious triumphs over the Moorish
power; but as the magnanimous and generous cavalier who
restored to freedom Abengalvon and his companions in misfortune.
How great loyalty must not the King of Castile and
Leon expect from him who, having conquered them, respected
even the enemies of his God and his country, because they
bore the name of king."</p>

<p>All the cavaliers who were with Don Fernando were also
much rejoiced at the arrival of Rodrigo, and felicitated him on
his victory at Oca. Rodrigo was soon seated at the king's
table, which honour he enjoyed during the few days he was
obliged to spend in Zamora, for Don Fernando was unwilling
that he should depart, and only consented at last on account
of the sacred object of his journey.</p>

<p>The day at last arrived on which he had to resume it.
Everything was ready for his departure, when a great commotion
was noticed amongst the townspeople who were
thronging towards the avenue which led to the royal Alcazar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
The king, Rodrigo, and the courtiers went out on a balcony,
and were much surprised at the strange spectacle which they
saw. A large number of Moors, richly clad, were leading more
than a hundred horses gorgeously caparisoned, and in addition
several mules all heavily loaded.</p>

<p>When the Moors arrived at the gates of the Alcazar, they
sent to ask Rodrigo's permission to appear in his presence.
He conceded it, having obtained the assent of the king, and
they entered the apartment in which the noble cavalier awaited
them, seated beside the king, who thus honoured him in order
that the Moslims might see in what estimation he was held.</p>

<p>"<i>Cid</i>," said to Rodrigo he who seemed to be the leader
of the ambassadors, "Abengalvon, king of Molina, Mahomad,
king of Huesca, Ali, king of Zaragoza, Osmin, king of Teruel,
and Hamet, king of Calatayud, whom you took prisoners in
the mountains of Oca, and to whom you generously restored
their freedom, send you their tributes and pay you homage, as
vassals who are pleased to do so. In addition, they send you,
as marks of friendship and gratitude, thirty sorrel horses,
thirty black horses, twenty white, and twenty dapple-grey,
besides valuable ornaments and precious stones for your
spouse, and rich cloths and good arms for yourself and your
knights."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken in your errand," replied Rodrigo
modestly and humbly; "you have called me <i>Cid</i>, which in
your language signifies 'a lord over vassals,' and I am not a
lord where my king is, but only the least of his vassals. Here
you see my king, and to him you must pay homage, and to
him you must offer the tributes and the marks of friendship
which Abengalvon and his friends have confided to your
charge."</p>

<p>"Say to your masters," interrupted the king, exceedingly
pleased by his humility, and addressing the Moors, "that
although their lord is not a king himself, he is seated beside
the King of Castile and Leon; tell them also that to him I
owe a large portion of the territories which I possess, and that
I consider it a greater glory to have him as my vassal than
to be a king myself. As you have called him 'Cid,' it is
my will that from this day he shall bear that name."</p>

<p>Rodrigo then received the tributes and gifts which the
Moorish kings had sent to him, and wrote to each of them a
letter, expressing his thanks, and promising to return their
loyalty and friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>The ambassadors received from the hand of Rodrigo
valuable presents, and departed, repeating the name of 'Cid,'
which the son of Diego Lainez was henceforth to bear, and to
which was soon added <i>Campeador</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which both Moors and
Christians conferred on him, on account of his constant and
glorious triumphs on the fields of battle.</p>

<p>A few hours after he had received this honourable embassy,
Rodrigo left Zamora, with the friends and servants who
accompanied him on his journey; all were in good spirits and
desirous of arriving at Compostela, in order to fulfil the duties
of Christian cavaliers before the altar of the holy apostle, and
afterwards practise other duties in the districts which were
frequently invaded by the Moors.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE VENGADOR AND RUI-VENABLOS CHANGED THEIR
OPINION REGARDING BELLIDO</p></blockquote>


<p>Three days after the disastrous attack of the bandits on the
Castle of Carrion, those that remained of them were still
encamped in the place where we left them in the twenty-third
chapter.</p>

<p>It was near nightfall, and the weather, which had been
cold and rainy on the preceding day, had become mild and
calm. The Vengador and Rui-Venablos were conversing
together, walking through the camp, in which were four tents,
one for the chiefs, one for the Infanta of Carrion, who was
still their prisoner, one for the wounded who had been
brought from Carrion, and one for the other members of
the band.</p>

<p>Near the encampment was a hill, from the summit of which
could be seen all the approaches, principally the road from
Carrion, for a considerable distance. The bandits kept watch
on it, and had been given strict orders to give notice when
they saw anyone approaching the camp, which proved that the
Vengador had lost the blind confidence which he had before
placed in his strength and in his good fortune; for when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>had but a dozen followers, and had as his enemies not alone
the brotherhood of the Salvadores, but all the inhabitants of the
country, he did not take such precautions. With all their
valour, the Vengador and Rui-Venablos could not but feel
discouraged by the terrible blow which they had just received.
Grief and despair had at first given them courage and confidence,
but when reflection came, the thought of those who
had remained entombed under the arched roof of the castle,
and the contrast between what the band had been and what it
now was, changed their energy and confidence into discouragement.</p>

<p>"The life we are leading here is a miserable one," said Rui-Venablos.
"Inaction not only causes discontent in our men,
but leaves us open to a sudden attack by our enemies; it
deprives us, besides, of precious time, which should be employed
in filling up the wide gaps which have been left in our ranks."</p>

<p>"We should indeed move away from here and shake off
this inaction which, in more ways than one, is weakening us,"
replied the Vengador; "but how can we do so until all our
companions who remained at Carrion have returned, and thus
place us in a position to give the Infanta her liberty? If we
departed hence, God only knows where we should have to go;
our companions would arrive with the hope of finding us, and
having made a long journey, which in their condition would be
very painful, they would be disappointed, and have to proceed
in search of us through the whole country, and many of them
would probably succumb before they could find us."</p>

<p>Martin bent down his head and continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"You, Rui-Venablos, and I, only bandits in appearance,
and our comrades being so in reality, should, it might be
supposed, have no compassion for them, and need not be
loyal to them; but we act as it is but right for us to do:
every honourable man should be loyal and compassionate
towards those who share their good or evil fortunes, whether
those men happen to be honourable or not. In truth, our
comrades are as honourable as we are, for if we examine
into the depths of their hearts and of their conduct, we must
place them, not in the category of bandits, but in that of men
whom hunger and oppression have forced to exercise a
shameful profession, and who, nevertheless, exercise it as
honourably as they can; for you know already, Rui, that if
there are in the band many men inclined to pillage and
assassination, more by inclination than by necessity, we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
curbed the instincts of several of them,&mdash;sometimes by persuasion,
at other times by punishment,&mdash;and got rid of the
others. Perhaps those who appear least worthy of compassion
are the very men who most deserve it. What are you and
I in the eyes of the public but bandit chiefs, deserving of
being hung and quartered, and exposed to public obloquy
on the highroads? Nevertheless, we dare shame and death
for one of the noblest causes,&mdash;one which even cavaliers have
fought for. Oh, how far are people from imagining that
Rui-Venablos and the Vengador, redoubtable bandits, who
attacked, pillaged, and consigned to the flames the mansions
of grandees, have no ambition but to avenge the murder of
one father, the tortures inflicted on another, the dishonour of
a girl, and the oppressions and crimes which noblemen,
wrongly so named, practise on the weak and unfortunate."</p>

<p>"That is quite certain, brother," replied Rui-Venablos.
"And Bellido himself, of whom both of us, I the first, had
suspicions, is a proof of this. Who can say but that he enlisted
in the band with an object just as honourable as ours? I
have changed my opinion regarding him so much, that if the
count should retain him in his castle, as God lives! Rui-Venablos
would risk a hundred lives to restore him to liberty.
Who does not love him, and desire that he should return
to us, having heard all that the wounded, who have come back
to us, relate of him? Certainly a man deserves praise and
love who, severely wounded in his head, forgets his own
sufferings, dedicates himself to serve and console those who
most likely suffer less than he does, protests with a brave
heart against the inhumanity of the count, whom he rebukes,
risking his anger, and will not leave the castle until the very
last of his companions has quitted it, saying, that as he is one
of their leaders, it is his duty to die rather than abandon his
comrades! Besides this, the circumstance of Bellido having
been the only one who escaped of all those on whom the ruins
of the arch fell, is another reason to consider him worthy of
our affection."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Martin; "from this day Bellido shall be our
equal. Amongst us there shall be no first or second; all
three shall be but as one, all three shall command the band, all
three shall have the same power. And, indeed, Bellido forecast
things better than either of us, and you see how events
have justified his opinion that half the band would perish in
the assault on the Castle of Carrion. We were indignant at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the plan he proposed to us, in order to carry out our enterprise;
but although we never could have approved of it,
perhaps our words would have been less severe if we could
have foreseen the dangers which he foreshadowed. Now that
we know how much Bellido is afflicted by the misfortunes of
his comrades, we must not feel surprised that, in order to save
us from an almost certain death, he should have ventured a
proposal which made him appear to us dishonourable and
disloyal."</p>

<p>Their conversation had proceeded thus far when the sentry
signalled that people were coming from the direction of Carrion.
The chiefs of the band joined him in order to see who they
were; and what was their surprise and delight when they found
that those who were approaching were Bellido and the last of
the bandits who had remained wounded in the power of Don
Suero.</p>

<p>Martin and Rui-Venablos hurried to meet them, and
embraced Bellido warmly, whose face, pale and emaciated,
gave expression to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Welcome, brother!" exclaimed both; "welcome, all of
you!"</p>

<p>"We were awaiting you with very great anxiety," said
Martin.</p>

<p>"It was not greater than the longing I felt to return to you,"
replied Bellido.</p>

<p>"Brother," said Rui-Venablos, "we have learned how loyal
your conduct has been in Carrion with regard to our companions,
and we, together with the entire band, shall consider
you in the future as its best and most faithful member."</p>

<p>"Oh, you confer an honour on me which I do not deserve,"
replied Bellido, with feigned modesty and emotion. "All our
comrades are so kind and grateful that those who arrived first
must have spoken too well of me, exaggerating the trifling
services I rendered them."</p>

<p>"What a terrible blow it was to us, Bellido! You prophesied
only too truly when you said that half the band would be
destroyed if we assaulted the castle by force," said Martin.</p>

<p>"Let us speak no more of that," replied Bellido, as if his
modesty resented any allusion to his foresight. "Let us forget
all that is past, and let us only endeavour to recover lost
ground. Let us work together with earnestness, with zeal
superior to all adverses, until we regain our lost strength, and
have again sufficient to ensure victory. Let us then return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Carrion, to avenge our unfortunate companions who were
butchered by the count in so barbarous a manner; for you
must know that the arched roof, which fell down on us, had
been previously prepared so as to kill all of us; and deaths
caused by such dastardly artifices can only be called vile
murders."</p>

<p>"And how were you able to save yourself from that
slaughter?"</p>

<p>"Only by a miracle."</p>

<p>"Relate to us then, brother, all that happened to you at
Carrion," said Martin, just as they reached the tents.</p>

<p>The wounded bandits entered that which the chiefs of the
band had arranged in the best possible manner, and the
Vengador, with his two companions, entered his tent. Martin
and Rui-Venablos could not do too much for Bellido, with the
view of ensuring his comfort and ease. They prepared, with
the utmost solicitude, a place where he could seat himself.
They saw that a meal was prepared for him, and they examined
the condition of his wound. Their care might be compared
to that which a father or mother would have lavished on a sick
and debilitated son.</p>

<p>"Do not trouble yourself, brothers, in preparing comforts
for me, for when with you, I feel well however I may be
placed. I assure you that this cursed wound which, during
the entire journey, made me suffer all the pains of hell, has
ceased to trouble me since I have seen you again. One would
say that you have the hand of a saint," added Bellido, with a
pleasant smile, "for you scarce touched me when I felt myself
completely cured. However, learn now what I suffered in
Carrion."</p>

<p>Martin and Rui-Venablos then seated themselves by his
side, ready to listen attentively to him.</p>

<p>"When that terrible blow was heard above the arched roof,
I foresaw the danger which threatened us, and I rushed to the
postern, to endeavour to facilitate the exit of my comrades by
opening the door, which had suddenly closed through the
impulse of the violent shock which made the entire building
quiver; however, the door, when closing, must have dragged
on with it some of the fragments which fell from the roof, and
wedged them in the door frame, for all the strength which I
exerted to open it was useless. Nevertheless, it was just
yielding when the arch crashed down, and I received so
violent a blow on the head that I instantly lost consciousness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
I am ignorant of the length of time I remained buried amid
the ruins and the dead bodies. When I regained my senses,
the moonlight was penetrating through the postern, which was
partly open, just as it was at the moment the catastrophe took
place. The spectacle which then presented itself to my view
was terrible; rivulets of blood were flowing from the ruins,
and on every side were protruding corpses, horribly disfigured
and mutilated; but not a voice, not a groan, not a sigh was
to be heard around me, which proved that I was the only one
in whom any life remained, of all those who were in the place
when the arched roof fell in. I turned my eyes away from
that horrible sight, and reflected as well as I could, for the loss
of blood, which continued to run from my head, had weakened
my faculties. I knew then that if I could not procure assistance,
I should soon lose my consciousness a second time, and
the count would find one corpse more under the ruins of the
roof. I managed to get out into the fields; bathed my wound
in the river which flows near the walls of the castle, bandaged
it as well as I could, and was thus able to arrest the flow of the
blood. I advanced a few steps on the road which leads hither,
but I stopped, hearing some people approach, and concealed
myself amongst the bushes. I was thus able to overhear the
conversation of some peasants who were coming out of the
castle and proceeding towards the town, talking on their way
of what had occurred. I thus learned that there were in the
castle several of my wounded companions, in danger of being
sacrificed to the anger of the accursed count, and I considered
that it would be a cowardly act not to share their fate. I then
entered the castle, taking advantage of the confusion which
still reigned there, and in a few minutes I was with my comrades
again. You know the rest; and I have only to add that
the count is not taking any precautions to protect the castle
against a fresh attack, for he considers us too much weakened
to attempt one again. For that reason we should endeavour
to recruit our forces as quickly as possible, and strike another
blow, which will certainly have better results, as Don Suero will
be unprepared."</p>

<p>"We shall do so, brother," exclaimed in one breath Martin
and Rui, clasping one after the other the hand of Bellido.</p>

<p>The three men continued to converse in a friendly way for
a short time, principally regarding the best means that could
be adopted in order to restore the band to its former strength;
and an hour later there was no other sound to be heard in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the camp but the footsteps of two or three sentries, stationed
on the paths leading to it, and who continued walking to
drive away the cold, which, if they had not done so, would
almost have frozen the blood in their veins. Nevertheless, all
who were in the tents had not gone to rest: Teresa and
Guillen were awake, seated beside a lamp, in the same place
where we have seen them but a few days previously. The
Infanta was no longer the same young girl, worn out by grief,
for whom the few kindly souls who saw her in the Castle of
Carrion felt so great compassion: a sweet and pleasant smile
now played constantly on her lips; her cheeks, a short time
before pale as those of a corpse, were commencing to be
tinged with the colour of the rose; and her soft eyes, formerly
dim and sad, shone with joy and animation. Teresa was
born to love, and love was the only element in which she
could really live; from the time, therefore, that her soul had
commenced to satisfy that imperious necessity, it might be
said that she had returned again to life, for the contentment
of the soul is a fountain of health for the body. How rapidly
time sped on for Teresa and Guillen in that poor tent, into
which penetrated from all sides the wet and the cold, in which
there was not even a rustic bench to use as a seat; where it
was necessary to lie on the ground, moist and rugged; where
they had not sufficient coverings to keep themselves warm;
where food was scanty and of the very coarsest kind; and
where, finally, they were in the power of a band of bandits.
How true is it that love adorns everything, and makes all
things easily borne and even sweet! All those privations were
little thought of by them, for they were sufficiently compensated
by the pleasure of constantly seeing each other, of
caring for each other, and of building beautiful castles in
the air.</p>

<p>"Teresa," said Guillen, with a loving smile, "we have been
painting the future with rosy tints, we have forgotten the real
world in order to make ourselves happy in an imaginary one;
would it not be well now to reflect for a few moments on the
obstacles against which our love must contend from the time
that we return to the castle? It is sad to have to awake from
so delicious a dream as ours has been, only to find ourselves
in a reality as bitter as that which awaits us."</p>

<p>"Let us think over that reality," replied Teresa, also trying
to smile, but in truth becoming very sad at the discomforting
prospect which Guillen had conjured up before her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must consider," said the page, "as to the kind of life
we shall have to lead when we arrive in Carrion; we must see
each other as little as possible, and in the presence of your
brother you must address me coldly and haughtily, in order
that he may not suspect our love."</p>

<p>"And do you believe, Guillen, that I could live without
often seeing you, or that I could speak coldly to you?"</p>

<p>"It will be also very painful to me to spend even an hour
without seeing you, but we must accept such a bitter sacrifice,
for what would be our fate if your brother found out that
there were any other relations between us but those of a
mistress and her servant?"</p>

<p>"Guillen, I repeat to you that I, formerly a weak and timid
woman, now feel myself strong and courageous; so much so,
that I would not hesitate to confess to my brother&mdash;ay, to the
whole world&mdash;that I love you."</p>

<p>"Confess it to your brother, Teresa! Ah no! for the
count would kill you, as he would look upon the love of the
Infanta of Carrion for an obscure page as a crime deserving
of being punished with death; for he considers that such as
I should kiss the ground on which their masters place their
feet. Let us conceal our love until the day arrives when you
need not be ashamed, in the eyes of the world, of loving me."</p>

<p>"Ashamed of loving you, Guillen! No, I shall never be
ashamed of that, for what armorial bearings could be found
more noble than the good and chivalrous soul which animates
you?"</p>

<p>"I know, Teresa, that for you such armorial bearings are
sufficient, but not for your brother, not for the world. Let
us conceal, I repeat, the love which we have for one another
whilst I remain in Carrion, for it will be only till the day that
the infidels make the first of their frequent raids into Castile
and Leon. I shall then join the first body of soldiers which
sets out to oppose the enemy, and the first fight in which I
take part shall win for me the first of the titles that will
enable me to demand your hand from your brother."</p>

<p>"Ah, Guillen, what bitter trials await our love, if they
were only those of the long separation which we must
endure!" exclaimed Teresa, thinking how illusory the hopes
of the page were, and on what a weak foundation his dreams
of happiness rested.</p>

<p>"Teresa," said the page, smiling in order to encourage her,
"do we not feel ourselves strong and courageous? Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
then, let us trust in God and in our love, for after a short
period of tempest we shall enjoy years of calm."</p>

<p>Whilst the lovers were thus conversing,&mdash;without thinking
of who might hear them, without even lowering their voices,
as if fearful of being heard and ridiculed by the bandits, who
would have found in the love of the Infanta and the page
only a subject for jests and noisy mirth,&mdash;a man issued from
the tent of the chiefs and approached, as noiselessly as
possible, that of Teresa. The man applied his ear carefully
to the canvas of the tent, greedy to hear the conversation of
the lovers, and when it had ceased, or at least had changed
its character, he returned to the tent from whence he had
come. If the darkness had not been so great, he might have
been seen to smile with satisfaction.</p>

<p>That man was Bellido Dolfos, who, surprising the love-making
of Doña Teresa and the page, had made up his mind
to gain some gold marks in exchange for&mdash;who knows but
for the lives of two good and innocent fellow-creatures!</p>

<p>All ages have had their traitors, but none of them more
vile, more despicable, more wicked than Bellido.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW TERESA AND GUILLEN BELIEVED THAT GOD HAD
TOUCHED THE HEART OF DON SUERO</p></blockquote>


<p>On the following day, just as the sun was beginning to lessen
the intense cold of the morning, Teresa and Guillen departed
from the encampment of the bandits, with their consent,
which had been obtained on the previous evening, when the
last of the wounded, who had been in the power of Don
Suero, returned with Bellido. As the journey was long and
the roads were bad, even worse than usual on account of the
heavy rain which had fallen, the Vengador had taken compassion
on the weak state of the Infanta, and had given her
a very strong horse, which was able to carry both her and the
page. They both, therefore, mounted it, extremely grateful for
the generosity of the bandits, and, above all, for the kindness
of their chief, who had afforded them protection and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
cared for them as well as he possibly could in that solitary
place.</p>

<p>The two young people were journeying thus towards Carrion,
conversing lovingly, when about half-way they met a servant
of Don Suero, who, on perceiving them, stopped, full of joy on
seeing his mistress at liberty, for all the inhabitants of the
castle, and of the surrounding district, loved and respected
her.</p>

<p>Teresa and Guillen were informed by him of all that had
occurred in the castle during their absence, and when they
were about to continue their journey, the Infanta asked
Gonzalo, for that was the name of the servant, whither he
was going.</p>

<p>"My lady," he replied, "Don Suero sends me with a letter
to the Count of Cabra."</p>

<p>"Is he sending to his friend the count for aid, fearing that
some other band may attack the castle?" asked Teresa.</p>

<p>"My lady, I can only tell you that my master received
tidings yesterday from Zamora, which caused him great
annoyance, so great that he beat me with a stick, shut himself
up in his apartment, and spoke to no person until this
morning, when he summoned me in order to give me a letter,
which he said I should bring to the Count of Cabra as quickly
as possible."</p>

<p>"Ah, you do not know, my good Gonzalo, what fear the
bandits inspire me with, now that I know how far their
audacity may go," said the Infanta, in order that the servant
might not suspect that she had any other object in having
thus questioned him. "Proceed on your way now, my good
Gonzalo, proceed whither your master sends you, for we shall
soon arrive at the castle, and relieve the anxiety which my
brother feels respecting us."</p>

<p>Gonzalo then continued his way to Burgos, and Teresa and
Guillen proceeded towards Carrion.</p>

<p>"Guillen," said Teresa, "that letter which my brother is
sending to the Count of Cabra causes me to foresee events
which may effect the peace of my family. The Count of
Cabra is the instrument which some of the grandees of Leon
and Castile have made use of, for many years, to plot treasons
and to carry out their mean revenges; for Don Garcia is a
skilled master in the art of conspiring, in everything that is
cowardly and cunning. To be in relations with him is the
same as being engaged in some treacherous action. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
he fled from his estates, although he had sufficient armed
retainers to resist the Moors, and came to Castile, he lives
by what those who have need of his assistance in carrying
out their plots, pay him."</p>

<p>"And I would stake a hundred to one that your brother
is plotting some treachery against the knight of Vivar, for
he considers him his greatest enemy, especially since Don
Rodrigo challenged him, and, on his refusing to fight with
him, got notices posted up throughout Castile and Leon,
denouncing his cowardice, calling him a bad, disloyal, and
treacherous cavalier, together with other disagreeable names
of a like nature, which your brother has not forgotten.
Besides, the great success of the cavalier of Vivar has made
him jealous, and he would be only too glad to clip the wings
which in so short a time have soared so high."</p>

<p>"I trust in God that we all shall not have to weep tears
of blood on account of the ambition, the injustice, and the
wild and ungovernable character of my brother. The house
of Carrion, formerly loved and respected by all, is now surrounded
by enemies. Who now treats it with respect? Who
would draw a sword in its defence, on the day when all its
enemies will rise in open hostility against it? It is indeed
powerful, and its vassals are numerous enough to form an
army, before which even the King of Castile and Leon might
well tremble; but how weak is power when it has not love
for its cement!"</p>

<p>Whilst engaged in this and other such conversations, the
Castle of Carrion appeared to their view. Teresa remembered
the joy with which in other times she had seen again those
grey walls, when returning with her parents from the frequent
excursions which they were in the habit of making, and when
they were always received with ovations by their vassals,
amongst whom the lords of Carrion were looked on as a
second providence. She remembered what she had suffered
within those walls from the time she had lost her parents,
and thought of what she might still have to suffer; and the
comparison of those two periods, so different from each other,
filled her heart with sadness. The Infanta almost felt grief
at having to return to the castle in which she had been born;
she was almost sorry for having left the camp of the bandits,
for in it, although she was the captive of the Vengador, she
had Guillen continually by her side, she could enjoy freely
the sweet and ardent love which dominated her soul, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
God alone knew what awaited her in the castle, God alone
knew if there she should ever see Guillen near her.</p>

<p>At length they arrived at the castle gate. Don Suero came
out to meet them, and, almost the first time in his life, he
embraced Teresa, and held out his hand to Guillen.</p>

<p>"You are heartily welcome, my sister," he said to the
Infanta. "If the natural roughness of my character, which
contrasts with the sweetness of yours, has ever caused you
to doubt of my affection, that want of confidence in me must
henceforth cease. Think, Teresa, how much I must love
you when, in order not to draw upon you the vengeance of
the bandits, I renounced the exercise of mine on those
accursed wretches, when they were in my power. You, who
know how undeserving of pity those bandits are, who committed
so many outrages in the district of Carrion, who
attacked so treacherously my castle; you, who know the
terrible chastisements which I am in the habit of inflicting
on those who offend me; you, my sister, can now understand
the great sacrifice I have made to ensure your safety.
If you had not been in the power of the bandits, my men-at-arms
would have followed the track of the miserable
remnant of the band of the Vengador, would have overtaken
them, and could have completely exterminated them; but
how could I pursue them when you were amongst them,
for, at the shooting of the first arrow by my men, those
pitiless wretches would have plunged their daggers in your
heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, thanks, brother!" replied Teresa, much
moved, and forgetting the brutal tyranny which the count had
practised on her during so long a time; for the heart of Teresa
was always open to gratitude and affection; and to the poor
girl, who had always seen frowns and severity on the face of
her brother, a kindly smile from him was of inestimable value.</p>

<p>"To you I return my best thanks, my good Guillen," said
Don Suero to the page, "for having so loyally accompanied
and guarded your mistress. I have always looked on you
differently than on my other attendants, and from to-day you
shall be the friend rather than the servant of the Count of
Carrion, for I know that you will become more and more
worthy of my esteem."</p>

<p>"My lord," replied Guillen in a stammering voice, "your
goodness is greater than my deserts. Was it not my simple duty
to protect and defend my mistress in every way in my power?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>The honourable page accused himself at that moment of
disloyalty to his master; his conscience was so upright, his
soul was so noble and delicate, that he could not help thinking
to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am vilely deceiving my master: Teresa is the most
valuable thing he has in his castle, and I have stolen it from
him, like an unfaithful servant; my lips speak one thing
and my heart feels another." Such were the thoughts that
were disturbing the page and bringing a colour to his
cheeks.</p>

<p>If the words which her brother had addressed to her were
sweet to Teresa, those which he had spoken to Guillen were
far sweeter to her. Oh, how delicious did the name of
"friend," which Don Suero had given to the page, sound in
her ears!</p>

<p>The Infanta entered her chamber filled with gladness, consolation,
and the hope of having happy days there instead of
the sad ones she had before spent in it; all this was not
founded so much on the favourable state of mind in which she
had found her brother, as on the certainty she felt that henceforth
there would be one in the castle who loved her tenderly
and disinterestedly.</p>

<p>"I shall see Guillen every day," she thought to herself, "for
my brother will be grateful to him for the sacrifices he has
made for me, the cares he has lavished on me, his grief at seeing
me deprived of almost the necessaries of life; and thus he
will attribute to my gratitude alone the preference I will show
him, my affection for him, and my desire to see him constantly
near me."</p>

<p>These thoughts, these hopes filled Teresa with happiness.
That apartment already seemed to her less lonely, less sad, less
gloomy; she no longer looked on herself as alone in the world;
she breathed with freedom; she saw the horizon of her life
smiling and bright. She went to that narrow window, at which
she had so often shed tears, and directed her gaze on the wide
stretch of country which was visible from it. The sun had
just disappeared behind a hill, and in the fields could be heard
the songs of the shepherds and labourers, and the summons to
prayer which was sounding from all the belfries that arose on
the extensive plain. This sight, which had so often formerly
saddened her heart, which had filled her with an invincible
and deep melancholy, now caused in her an entirely different
feeling; the songs of the country people, the chimes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
bells, seemed to her as if they were celebrating her happiness
and announcing it to her.</p>

<p>She stood for a long time motionless at the window, buried
in the contemplation of her newly awakened hopes, blessing
God who had sweetened the bitterness of her life, and giving
thanks to her mother, to whose prayers she believed that she
owed a great part of her happiness; for that mother who, in
other times, loved her, pitied her, and consoled her, must have
implored the mercy of God in her favour, in favour of the sad
orphan, isolated in the world and persecuted by her own
brother, by him who, when her mother died, should have loved,
pitied, and consoled her.</p>

<p>When Teresa was most absorbed in those sweet reflections,
she heard some person entering her chamber, and almost at
the same moment the voice of her brother, who thus affectionately
addressed her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Teresa, my sister, I could not retire to rest without first
embracing you, without seeing that you have everything necessary
for your comfort, without beseeching you to forget for
ever my harshness towards you, for, from this day, I shall not
be a tyrant to you, as I have hitherto been, but a brother
to my good and gentle Teresa!"</p>

<p>Saying this, Don Suero opened his arms and clasped the
Infanta to his breast, with a seeming tenderness, which filled
the sweet girl with pleasure.</p>

<p>She endeavoured to speak, but could not, for the excitement
of joy smothered her voice. If at that moment Guillen
had come to the door of the chamber, he would have blessed
God for having granted to him the felicity of being loved by
that angel, whose heart was overflowing with affection and
tenderness. For, when the noble maiden exhibited such
affection for her executioner, what would it not be for the kind-hearted
youth who loved, who adored her with the purest
affection and the most reverent adoration that a man can offer
to a human creature.</p>

<p>Teresa was not able to express to her brother by means of
words the gratitude, the tenderness, and the joy which filled
her heart, but a kiss, which her lips imprinted on the cheek of
Don Suero, spoke for her.</p>

<p>"My sister," continued the count, still in an affectionate
tone of voice, "until I saw you in danger, until you were absent
from me, I did not really know how much I loved you. Until
one loses a thing, he often does not recognise its value;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
whilst your sweet voice, your tenderness, and your cares for
me, soothed my troubles, and made life more tolerable&mdash;a
life constantly tortured, I know not how, whether by a fatal
destiny that thwarts all my plans, that constantly opposes my
will, and makes me hateful even in the eyes of those most
disposed to indulgence and affection; whilst I enjoyed this
blessing, I did not know how to appreciate it; but as soon as
I was deprived of it, I understood its value, and constantly
lamented its loss. You cannot know, my sister, how much I
felt your absence, how I longed for your return, what anxiety
on your account drove my sleep away, whilst you were in the
power of the bandits. Every moment I feared either that a
dagger might be plunged in your breast, or that some villain
might treacherously stain the purity of the angel, whose
custody the most tender and holy of women confided to me
when she went to heaven."</p>

<p>"Oh, may God bless you, brother!" exclaimed Teresa, at
last recovering her speech, as if God had come to her aid when
she wished to praise her mother; "God bless you, brother,
for speaking thus of her who gave us our being, and for so
reverencing her memory! What will not be her pleasure in
looking down from heaven on the love you manifest for me!
Do you remember her last words, brother, do you remember
them? 'Love each other,' she said; 'let you, my son,' she
added, looking towards you, 'watch over your sister; be her
guide, her shield; for she is weak, and has no one in the
world but you to protect her!' We both then knelt down by
the bedside, and the last words she heard was the solemn
promise we made to follow her counsels and fulfil her wishes."</p>

<p>"Yes, my sister, I remember the last words of our mother;
perhaps I have forgotten them for a long time; but I repent
of that forgetfulness, and wish to expiate my fault, and give
back to you that affection which I have denied you; loving
you henceforth, and, if necessary, sacrificing my life for your
happiness."</p>

<p>"Oh, my brother," exclaimed the Infanta, "how can I
ever repay you for those dear promises?"</p>

<p>"With your love, Teresa, with your love, and with the
cancelling from your memory of any cruelty with which I may
have hitherto treated you. From this day you shall be
absolute mistress of this castle, and even I will submit with
pleasure to your commands. Mention to me the dueñas and
the maidens you wish to attend on you, the servants you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
desire to have at your orders, and from this very night they
shall be ready to obey you."</p>

<p>"Those who have hitherto waited on me, my brother, will
be sufficient."</p>

<p>Teresa believed that the occasion had presented itself to
speak of Guillen, to justify in the eyes of her brother the preference
she intended to show him, and to heighten the good
opinion which Don Suero already had of him. Her cheeks,
however, became covered with blushes, for the maiden had
never concealed her real feelings, but now she felt herself
obliged to do so, and was fearful lest her words might reveal
them to her brother; she ventured to say, nevertheless,
endeavouring to conceal her agitation&mdash;</p>

<p>"The good Elvira is sufficient to attend to me; but as
years have deprived her, to a great extent, of her hearing, I
cannot pass, conversing with her, the long winter evenings, and
I would wish that Guillen might sometimes keep me company;
you know how pleasant his conversation usually is, always
brightened with narratives which his natural cleverness has
enabled him to treasure up, and which he knows how to make
very entertaining."</p>

<p>"Well, then, sister, although Guillen is very useful to me,
you can have him with you as often as you desire, for indeed
that youth is not only the most discreet of our servants, but
also the most loyal and noble-hearted."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you only knew, my brother, the proofs of devotion
and loyalty which he gave me during our sojourn with the
bandits! If you only knew the cares he lavished on me, with
what assiduity he guarded me whilst I slept, with what solicitude
he endeavoured to lessen the privations I had to endure,
and above all, with what self-forgetfulness, with what bravery,
in short, he shed his blood to defend me from one of the
bandits! Oh, my brother, Guillen is the son of an humble
man, but the heart of a cavalier beats in his breast."</p>

<p>Teresa stopped, fearing that if she continued to praise the
page thus, she might go farther than it was prudent to do.</p>

<p>"Do you say, Teresa, that Guillen shed his blood for you?"
asked Don Suero, much astonished.</p>

<p>"Yes; one night we were watching together in a dilapidated
tent, which the bandits had allotted to us, when one of those men
entered it, and commanded Guillen to leave him alone with
me; but the faithful page answered, that rather than do so, he
would lose his life by my side. A terrible fight then took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
place between Guillen and the bandit, and I was saved, but
the dagger of our persecutor wounded the hand which was
defending me."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, thanks, my good page, my good friend, for
that is the name I shall give him henceforth!" exclaimed Don
Suero, with a seeming tenderness and enthusiasm which increased
very much the happiness of Teresa.</p>

<p>"My sister," added the count, "both of us have need of
repose, for it is near midnight. You have not slept well for a
long time, and I may almost say the same of myself, for the
thoughts of the dangers that menaced you drove slumber from
me."</p>

<p>The count then quitted the chamber of Teresa, having
embraced her affectionately. He proceeded to the place
where Guillen was awaiting his orders, and extending his hand
to him, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Guillen, my friend, thanks for your loyalty. My sister
has just related to me all that you did for her, and I shall
know how to recompense you. From to-day it is my desire
that you should always be at the orders of the Infanta. Go to
her apartments before retiring to rest, and see if she has any
commands for you."</p>

<p>The page felt himself almost wild with joy. He could not
find words to reply to his master, for all appeared too poor to
express his gratitude, but went off at once to her apartments,
his head almost turned with the delight he felt.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the habit he had acquired of respectfully
calling out the name of the Infanta on approaching her
rooms, he would have allowed himself to be borne away by the
gladness which was intoxicating him, by that species of madness
with which he was possessed; he would have approached
Teresa, pouring forth the most affectionately familiar names
that the vocabulary of love contains. As he approached the
chamber, in very high spirits, he was evidently on the point of
doing so, but he checked himself, and only said, on entering
the chamber&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lady, the count has sent me to receive your orders."</p>

<p>However, Teresa made him a familiar sign to come near
her; then Guillen abandoned his gravity, at once approached
the maiden, and said to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, how happy I am, Teresa&mdash;how happy! To be always
by your side, to see you at all hours!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Guillen, yes," interrupted the Infanta. "The finger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
God has touched the heart of my brother. How happy we
are, Guillen!" And she added, with the smile of a child who
amuses itself with other children, "Let us now be content with
the happiness that we have already experienced, for there will
be time enough to enjoy that which smiles on us from all
sides."</p>

<p>"Yes, Teresa, yes, my angel," murmured the page in a low
voice, "let us retire to rest, for when the heart is full of love
there is happiness in sleep. Go to your rest, my love, lulled
to sleep by the happiness which will lull me to sleep also."</p>

<p>And the happy lovers parted from each other.</p>

<p>Teresa did not send for Elvira to undress her, as she was in
the habit of doing, for she desired to be alone, entirely alone,
in order to give herself up unreservedly to her happy thoughts.
She knelt down and prayed, thanking God for the joy which
she experienced, with as much fervour and earnestness as a
saint could have shown if the gates of heaven, in a divine
vision, had been opened before him.</p>

<p>She then retired to her bed, and in a very short time was in
a deep sleep.</p>

<p>The count was also sleeping&mdash;but let us not approach his
couch, for the angel of purity does not repose in it, for it is
profaned by unholy love. Let us approach that of Guillen or
that of Teresa&mdash;let us only approach that of the latter, for the
chaste love which sleeps in the one also sleeps in the other.</p>

<p>Teresa was dreaming of Guillen.</p>

<p>Guillen was dreaming of Teresa.</p>

<p>There is scarcely anyone in the world who has not dreamed,
some time or other, that the bonds of love united him to a
being who until then had been indifferent to him, and on
awaking, and for some time after, had thought with delight on
that being, and where formerly he had seen only an ordinary
individual who awoke no feelings in his soul, now sees a being
surrounded with enchantment and poetry. How many constant,
ardent loves, fruitful of joys and sorrows, have had their
birth in a dream!</p>

<p>Well, then, if the being who has been always indifferent to
us, and to whom we do not owe sacrifices of love, appears in
dreams surrounded with enchantment, ideality, and poesy,
how must not that being appear to us whom we have long
loved, and who loves us sincerely, who has exposed his life to
save us; who is our only hope in this world; who physically
and morally has so many claims on our love, and appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
our eyes surrounded with so many charms? Such was the
case of Teresa in regard to Guillen.</p>

<p>How beautiful, how sweet, how celestial, if it is right to
employ that word to express complete earthly happiness, was
the dream which presented itself to the Infanta of Carrion
immediately on her falling asleep, picturing to her the last
loving words of Guillen! She dreamt that she was in an
enchanted land, in a paradise; light, flowers, perfumes,
harmonies, palaces of gold and diamonds surrounded her;
there men and women had the bodies of angels, and also the
souls of angels; there were neither masters nor servants in
that beautiful place, neither oppressed nor oppressors, for the
will of one was the will of all; there was a common soul-feeling
amongst them, as there is a common atmosphere for
all living beings; there the sky was ever blue and calm, and
the sun was never clouded; there the verdure of the fields,
and the colour, and the freshness, and the perfume of the
flowers were eternal; there the birds always sang, but their
music was ever sweet and in delicious harmony, like the harps
of the seraphim; there no serpent hissed, and no wild animal
lurked in the thickets; there the feet of the wayfarers were not
wounded by thorns or brambles; there storms did not rage,
the sun did not parch the ground, and the frost, snow, and
biting blasts of winter did not benumb; there the trees were
ever laden with scented blossoms and delicious fruits; and
there, in the midst of that land of enchantment, of that heaven,
she and he lived, the two beloved of each other, Guillen and
Teresa, and their love was so great, and their happiness so
immense, that they almost feared to excite the envy of the
inhabitants of that paradise, all happy, all lovers, all intoxicated
with boundless and endless delights. And that sweet dream,
marvellously like to one which had presented itself also to
Guillen at the same time, bound Teresa in calm sleep, until
she was aroused from it by the songs of the birds and the
bright morning light, entering through the window, which in
her happiness she had forgotten to close.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE COUNT OF CABRA SANG A BALLAD FOR THE
COUNT OF CARRION</p></blockquote>


<p>Very few conspiracies were worked out in Castile and Leon
without Don Garcia, Count of Cabra, having taken part in them
as the chief plotter, for, in order to obtain employment on such
occasions, he had versed himself thoroughly in such matters.</p>

<p>Don Garcia had formerly possessed a rich seigniory in
Andalusia, as its name indicated. As this district of Cabra
was very much coveted by the Moors, and as their territories
lay adjacent to it, their attacks consequently were very much
to be dreaded; as the count was a coward and powerful at
the same time, his possessions were defended by strong
fortresses and numerous men-at-arms. These circumstances
had prevented the Moors from attacking them, even after
Don Garcia had become their owner through the death of his
father, who, with a handful of soldiers and fortifications by
no means strong, had repulsed on repeated occasions the expeditions
which they had organised against him. They, believing
that the son had inherited the valour of his father, and seeing
that he had better means of defence than the late count,
thought it useless to renew their attacks; however, the
effeminate kind of life which Don Garcia led and the circumstance
of his never being seen in combats, as all other
Christian cavaliers were, soon made them understand that
Don Garcia was only heir to his father's name and estates;
they therefore got together a large body of men and entered
the territory of Cabra.</p>

<p>The vassals of the count and the soldiers, who garrisoned
the fortifications on the frontiers, defended themselves bravely;
but, as Don Garcia did not send them aid,&mdash;having kept the
main body of his men in the town, the most important place
in his seigniory, fearful for his personal safety,&mdash;they yielded
chiefly on account of the desperation and anger which the
conduct of the count caused them, and the Moors advanced
as far as the town of Cabra.</p>

<p>That town was surrounded by good walls, had a strong
castle, and fortifications capable of sustaining a long siege;
nevertheless, Don Garcia abandoned it precipitately, with his
family, without even an arrow having been discharged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>He went to Castile, and established his residence in Burgos,
where he had some property; accustomed, however, to ostentation
and extravagant living, it was not long before he had
sold all he possessed, and soon found himself, if not in a
state of misery, at least surrounded by privations such as he
had never before experienced, and which were insupportable
to him. Another cavalier, with more courage than the count,
would have collected together a sufficient number of adventurous
soldiers, who were abundant at that epoch; would have
proceeded to one of the provinces in the power of the Moors;
would have fought against them, and perhaps regained his
patrimony. Don Garcia, however, would have preferred to
die in misery rather than fight, face to face, and arm to arm,
against either Moors or Christians.</p>

<p>He had hopes of getting his son, Nuño Garciez, married
to some rich maiden of Castile or Leon, and until such hope
could be realised, he subsisted on the payments he received
from many grandees, who had great confidence in his cleverness
and in the cunning which he knew well how to employ in
the planning and carrying out of their schemes and conspiracies.
This, then, had become the almost constant occupation of
Don Garcia.</p>

<p>His son Nuño was still very young at the period of which
our story treats, and his heart was just as effeminate and
cowardly as that of his father. The latter, however, possessed
a genius for intrigue, which quality was wanting in Nuño; he
was stupid, he was but a puppet whom his father used for his
own purposes, he had no will of his own, and he was looked
on with contempt by his equals in rank.</p>

<p>Don Garcia had solicited for his son the hand of the
Infanta of Carrion, but Don Suero had refused it, not on
account of the personal disadvantages of Nuño, for in his eyes
such things were of little moment, but because avarice was
a passion which dominated him,&mdash;why should he consent to
the marriage of his sister with the son of the Count of Cabra,
who was not the owner of a square foot of ground?</p>

<p>Don Suero had often thought of having recourse to Don
Garcia, in order that he might obtain his aid in a conspiracy
against his enemies, and especially against Rodrigo Diaz; but
he had always hesitated to do so, feeling that the return for
his services, which the Count of Cabra would demand, would
be the hand of Teresa for his son.</p>

<p>The fame of the cavalier of Vivar was increasing rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and in the same proportion were the hostile feelings between
him and Don Suero becoming more bitter; the latter considered,
therefore, that the time had arrived when he should
take some decisive step, in order to clip the wings of one who
was soaring so high, as Guillen had said; for, if he did not do
so, he felt that his own ruin was not very far remote.</p>

<p>Four-and-twenty hours after the departure from Carrion of
Gonzalo, the messenger of the count, with a letter for Don
Garcia, the latter arrived at the gates of the castle, accompanied
by the same Gonzalo and some well-armed attendants,
whom he always kept about him, and whom he paid handsomely
for acting as his guards, as he knew well that such
protection was necessary for him.</p>

<p>Don Suero was in the company of Teresa, with whom he
was chatting affectionately, when the arrival of Don Garcia
was announced to him. The joy of the count was as great as
the dismay of Teresa. She was ignorant of the fact that he
had solicited her hand for Nuño, but, nevertheless, the presence
of the Count of Cabra in the castle filled her with
forebodings and fear; for, as the reader already knows, she
had learned much concerning him, and knew that his visit to
her brother could not be for any good purpose.</p>

<p>Don Suero hastened to receive Don Garcia, so much the
more pleased as he had feared that the refusal of Teresa's
hand to his son might have prevented his coming. A short
time after he had left his sister's chamber, he and his guest
were together in a private apartment, where they could not be
overheard by anyone.</p>

<p>"I thank you, Don Garcia, for having come so promptly
to honour my house by your presence," said Don Suero,
intending to secure the goodwill of the Count of Cabra by the
friendliness and softness of his accents.</p>

<p>"It is I who am honoured," answered Don Garcia, "and
you will not doubt how honoured I feel at being with you, if
you remember how much I desired that we might be united,
not alone by the bonds of friendship, but also by those of
relationship."</p>

<p>Don Suero knew that the count had not abandoned his
old pretensions; however, as he only intended to accede to
them when he could accomplish his ends by no other means,
he thought it better to pretend not to hear the allusion of
Don Garcia, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What news has been received from Zamora?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very satisfactory tidings for the friends of the cavalier
of Vivar have come to Burgos; not only has Don Fernando
conferred great honours on him, but also rich tributes have
been sent to him by Abengalvon and the four other Moorish
kings who were taken prisoners by him in the battle of the Oca
Mountains. I assure you that this news has pained me not a
little, as, De Vivar being your enemy, his great success must
be exceedingly disagreeable to you: as your friend I cannot
but deplore the triumphs of your enemy."</p>

<p>"I am thankful to you, Don Garcia, for your devotion and
friendship; but do you only deplore the rise of Rodrigo
because it militates against me? Have you no other motives
for hating him?"</p>

<p>"What other motives could I have?"</p>

<p>"It is strange, my lord count, that in this matter you have
so little foresight when in all others you forecast events so
well. Do you not belong to the most illustrious nobility of
Castile?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and that confers such honour on me that I can
never forget the fact."</p>

<p>"Well, then, in a very short time the most noble and
powerful grandees of Castile and Leon will be at the side of
De Vivar, as your squire is at yours; in a short time De Vivar
will regard only as vassals those who to-day are greater than
he is; soon the king, Don Fernando himself, will be ruled
by that audacious and haughty soldier, to whom he now
dispenses so many favours, never thinking that he is cherishing
the raven which will pick out his eyes. And do you not think,
Don Garcia, that it is your duty to curb this wild steed, which
threatens to trample down you, as well as so many others?
Do you believe that De Vivar, to whom even the king is
inferior in pride and ambition, will not consider himself greater
than you, and consequently will humiliate you under his
feet?"</p>

<p>"De Vivar, if he is not my friend, is also not my enemy,"
replied Don Garcia, the words of Don Suero not having
changed in the least his habitual calmness; and he added, with
a smile, slightly sarcastic: "Does it appear to you that it is
fitting for one good cavalier, as I consider myself to be, to
envy the good fortune of another cavalier, much less to injure
one who has never done me a wrong? Let that be for you,
good count, let you thwart the plans of De Vivar, as you are
his mortal enemy, on account of insults which one who prides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
himself on being a noble and a cavalier should never forget.
I, far from disapproving of the enmity you bear to Don
Rodrigo, and your intention to endeavour to prevent his rise,
sincerely applaud it. If I were in your position, I would wage
a war, without truce, against De Vivar; I would sacrifice my
repose, my property, even my life, to the avenging of my
honour,&mdash;for it must be confessed that you have been cruelly
outraged by Rodrigo Diaz. Who in Castile and Leon does
not remember the proclamations he caused to be posted about,
branding you as a coward and a felon? Go through the
country places and the towns of Castile, and you will hear the
people singing gentle ballads, in which those proclamations of
De Vivar are amplified and improved on"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cease, Don Garcia, be silent, for the fire of hell is burning
in my breast!" exclaimed Don Suero, stamping so violently on
the floor that it vibrated.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," continued Don Garcia, "but as your friend,
knowing that you do not often go far from your castle, and
therefore are ignorant of what is said of you, I thought it well
to inform you, so that you might take steps to punish the
offenders. If you had travelled hither with me from Burgos
you could have heard the rustics chanting the ballads I have
mentioned. Just listen, in order that you may have some idea
of the malice of the Castilian peasants; listen to what I heard
sung shortly after I left Burgos."</p>

<p>And the count repeated, in that monotonous and melancholy
chant with which the women of Castile lull their infants to
sleep&mdash;</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"In Carrion, in its Castle,<br />
At his dinner seated,<br />
Was its owner, Don Suero,<br />
That disloyal count.<br />
Pages, elegant and young,<br />
Served to him his cup,<br />
And in the polished cup<br />
Was wine to make him drunk.<br />
The count is fond of wine,<br />
But dreads to shed his blood."<br />
</p>

</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Earth, earth! Open and bury me in your depths!" roared
Don Suero, writhing as if he were suffering the torments of the
damned. "Be silent, Don Garcia! I would throw myself from
this window, or plunge a dagger into my heart, if it were
not necessary to live in order to bury it in the breasts of those
who thus calumniate me and scoff at me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I like to see you thus, enraged when insulted," said the
Count of Cabra, clasping the hand of Don Suero, whose veins
had swelled to such an extent that they appeared as if they
were about to burst; whose eyes were injected with blood,
and from whose mouth foam was oozing, as from that of an
infuriated wild beast,&mdash;"thus do I like to see you, enraged and
not resigned."</p>

<p>And Don Garcia continued&mdash;</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"Envoys, sent by Don Rodrigo,<br />
Castile's bravest cavalier,&mdash;<br />
Born in a lucky hour,<br />
Fearing no one in the world,&mdash;<br />
Then announced to him their message,<br />
And these words to him they spake:<br />
'Don Suero, brave Rodrigo,<br />
The good cavalier of Vivar,<br />
Calls you forth, for having libelled<br />
Him; for having called him coward.<br />
If you don't accept his challenge,<br />
Cavalier no more are you.<br />
Buckle on the spur no longer,<br />
Never mount again a charger,<br />
Eat no white bread at your table,<br />
Ne'er divert yourself with ladies.'<br />
<br />
'Now depart from this, ye envoys,<br />
Bear the message to your master,<br />
That he may do as he pleases;<br />
On the field I shall not meet him.'<br />
Thus then spake Count Don Suero,<br />
That disloyal cavalier;<br />
And he turned to his pages,<br />
To receive his sparkling cup;<br />
For the count is fond of wine,<br />
But he is not fond of blood."<br />
</p>

</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Ah! they say that I am not fond of blood! I shall make
that of those rustics flow in torrents," cried the Count of
Carrion, infuriated, mad with anger. "Tell me, who are those
that dare to insult me with such accursed ballads?"</p>

<p>"All the peasants of Castile are constantly singing that
which you have just heard. Judge how often I must have
listened to it, when my memory retains it, and I have not,
indeed, a good memory for such things. But it is not the
rustics alone who revile and mock you; it would be as unjust
and difficult to chastise them as the echo which repeats the
words of a calumniator. Return insult for insult to De Vivar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
humiliate him as he has humiliated you, and you will see
how those very same rustics will call you in a short
time&mdash;</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"'The bravest cavalier,<br />
Born in a lucky hour,<br />
Fearing no one in the world.'"<br />
</p>

</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you are right; my vengeance must fall on De
Vivar, for he is my real enemy, my persecutor, my fate, my
evil genius. But how shall I be able to conquer him? How
can I humble him? How can I throw back in his teeth the
ignominy which he has heaped on me?"</p>

<p>"Why? can you not bind on your sword; does not the
heart of a knight beat in your breast? Fight with him as the
bandits have fought with those who, at the Inn of the Moor,
were bearing a maiden off from them; fight with him as Don
Gome de Gormaz, as Martin Gonzalez, the Aragonian, fought
with him"&mdash;</p>

<p>Don Suero trembled at this recalling to his mind of the
valour of Rodrigo, which Don Garcia saw with much satisfaction,
and replied, interrupting the Count of Cabra&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would do so, if God had given to my arm as much
strength as He has given to my heart; but the bad health,
which constantly darkened my youth, and which still afflicts
me, has not permitted me to perfect myself in the use of arms,
so as to be a match for De Vivar, who, thanks not to his heart,
but to his strength and skill, is able to unhorse an adversary
with a stroke of his lance."</p>

<p>The Count of Cabra smiled, not so much at the puerile
excuse of Don Suero, as with satisfaction at seeing that the
road was being made easy which would lead him to the
accomplishment of his desires.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied, "De Vivar, fighting against you in
the lists, would have that advantage; but there is another kind
of contest, more safe, and allowable to a cavalier whose
natural incapacity to avenge his honour with sword and lance
has been taken advantage of in order to insult him. Where
the sword cannot reach, cunning can, my good count."</p>

<p>"I understand you, Don Garcia, I understand you, and I
am resolved to follow your advice; but do you think that I
would be victorious in such a fight?"</p>

<p>"If you carry it out dexterously, I have no doubt of it."</p>

<p>"But how can I plot cleverly, when that kind of thing is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
new to me? I am wanting in friends to assist me, and De
Vivar has many such."</p>

<p>"You say that you are wanting in friends?"</p>

<p>"The only person to whom I can give that name is you,
Don Garcia, and you have refused me your aid several times
when I asked you to help me in such a struggle as you now
advise."</p>

<p>"I never refused you my aid, Don Suero; the only thing I
did was to ask from you a hostage, so that I could depend on
your silence in case our plans might fail; and if you now
desire my assistance you must give me that hostage."</p>

<p>"Don Garcia, my family would be much honoured by being
united to yours, for you are as noble as a king, although you
have been unfortunate; but my sister is still but a child, both
on account of her age and of her natural fragility. And
besides, to marry her would be but to kill her, for she desires
either to live and die by my side or to go into a convent. If
you only knew, Don Garcia, how I love her, how sad my life
would be without her, you would praise me for not wishing to
force her will. I was still a beardless youth when both of us
were left orphans, and from that time she has been my only
comfort, and I hers."</p>

<p>"When the Infanta is the wife of my son, you will both
cease to be orphans, for in me and in my wife, Doña Elvira,
she and you will find parents as affectionate as those whom
you have lost."</p>

<p>"I appreciate, as I should, the desire which animates you;
however, respect the feelings of that poor girl, very unhappy on
account of her sad disposition and her delicate constitution."</p>

<p>"Measure by the love that you have for your sister that
which I feel for my son, and you need not be surprised that I
desire to procure for Nuño the peace of mind that he has lost
since the time he first saw Doña Teresa, and heard both
cavaliers and peasants speaking so highly of her virtues and
good sense."</p>

<p>"I cannot do less than extol the feelings which move you
to ask for your son the hand of my sister," said Don Suero,
though now almost certain that he would never be able to
obtain the assistance of the Count of Cabra, except at the
price of the hand of Teresa, "but it is impossible to comply
with your wishes."</p>

<p>"And it is also impossible for me to make known to you an
excellent plan for freeing yourself from De Vivar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me, Don Garcia, what that plan is, and in exchange
demand from me my treasures, demand from me"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The hand of your sister. I desire nothing more; I want
nothing more."</p>

<p>"Oh, this miserable fate of mine! Can I not advance a
step without losing a portion of my heart? Let De Vivar
come, let all my enemies come, and tear life from me; for then
the torments I suffer will cease."</p>

<p>"Yes, De Vivar will come, your enemies will come, but
they will leave you your life, that you may spend it dishonoured,
a fugitive, without a spot of land on which to place
your feet, without a hut to shelter you, with scarcely a piece of
bread to put into your mouth. And then your sister, that
delicate girl whom you love so much, will die of grief, of
exposure, of hunger, or will marry some peasant, in order to
secure an existence for herself. Do you perchance consider
yourself powerful enough to continue despising De Vivar?
Powerful and rich and haughty were the Count of Gormaz
and Martin Gonzalez, and notwithstanding they died at his
feet,&mdash;and that when Rodrigo was neither as skilful nor as
strong as he now is; he had not then kings as his vassals."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Don Garcia," interrupted at this point Don
Suero, "my sister shall be the wife of your son if Rodrigo
Diaz ceases to live, or, at the least, if he is banished from
Castile and Leon."</p>

<p>"He shall die, he shall die; have no doubts of that, Don
Suero," exclaimed the Count of Cabra, embracing De Carrion,
full of joy; and he added, "Are you quite sure, however, that
your sister will consent to a marriage with my son?"</p>

<p>"My sister," replied Don Suero, "shall do my will; and if
not, let her beware."</p>

<p>And whilst poor Teresa, the gentle, loving girl, was in her
apartment with Guillen, dreaming of a paradise of love, those
two cowards, with souls of chaff and hearts of flint, were
plotting her slavery, and also a vile plan for the assassination
of Rodrigo, the most perfect cavalier of Castile, the good
knight, the conqueror, he who was born in a lucky hour, he
who in a fortunate hour girt on his knightly sword.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE KING AND RODRIGO, HAVING SAID GOOD PRAYERS,
GAVE GOOD SWORD STROKES</p></blockquote>


<p>The king, Don Fernando, having left the works for the rebuilding
of Zamora in a forward state, was preparing to return
to Burgos, where he intended to devote himself exclusively to
the improvement of the laws, of agriculture, and of the arts,
taking advantage of the tranquillity that reigned in his
kingdoms, and desirous of ameliorating many grievances in
them, as such had been rather increasing for some time back.</p>

<p>Before returning to Burgos, he desired to go to Compostela,
with the object of visiting the shrine of the holy Apostle James.
When Rodrigo, just as he was about to leave that last-named
city, learned the king's intention, having finished his devotions,
he determined to await the king there, in order to
accompany him on his journey to Burgos.</p>

<p>Don Fernando arrived in due course at Compostela, and for
some days devoted himself with much fervour to pious
exercises, for he was as good a Christian as he was a brave
warrior. He was solacing himself with the hope of soon being
in the bosom of his family, when the Moors of Portugal unexpectedly
broke the peace which they had arranged with Don
Fernando, crossing the frontiers of the Christian districts, and
committing various kinds of outrages.</p>

<p>Don Fernando felt that he must sacrifice his personal
tranquillity to the protection of his subjects, and to the
punishment of the infidels, who, if he did not arrest their
progress, would become more daring, and extend their depredations
farther. He asked advice from Don Rodrigo and other
cavaliers, and all, especially the latter, counselled war.</p>

<p>That, therefore, was decided on. The king and Rodrigo
Diaz collected together in a few days an army sufficiently large,
and set out for Portugal, with the determination of attacking
the first Moorish castle which they might find on their route;
for this purpose they had provided themselves with good
materials of war.</p>

<p>Near Monzao they overtook a large body of infidels who
were hastening back to Portugal with the rich booty that
they had seized in the district of Tuy, and routed them
completely, taking back from them all the plunder which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
had possessed themselves of. Don Fernando divided it
amongst his troops, and this inspirited the Christian army to
such an extent, that it followed the track of the comparatively
few Moors who had escaped from the battle, and who, under
the command of the Alcaide<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of Cea, had succeeded in taking
refuge in the castle in that town.</p>

<p>The Castle of Cea was very strong, was well garrisoned, and
provided with provisions sufficient to bear a long siege; for
these reasons Don Fernando believed that an attempt to take
it would result in a loss both of time and men. However, as
such obstacles were only incentives to the courage of the Cid,
for by that name Rodrigo was now known, he believed that
the Christian army should not pass on farther without giving a
fresh proof of its power by destroying that first bulwark of the
Moslems.</p>

<p>"Sire," said Rodrigo to the king, "I am about to ask a
favour of you, which I trust you will grant."</p>

<p>"Speak, Rodrigo," replied Don Fernando, "for you already
know how desirous I am to gratify you."</p>

<p>"The favour I ask of you is, that you will permit me, this
very day, to plant the Christian standard with my own hands
on the walls of the Castle of Cea."</p>

<p>"O good Cid, who is there but must love you as the
best cavalier in the world!" exclaimed Don Fernando, clasping
him to his breast. "With a hundred knights like you, I
would undertake to drive the Moors, not alone from Portugal,
but from all Spain. It is not idle talk when the people say
that you were born in a lucky hour! I applaud your valour,
Rodrigo; my heart swells and rejoices when I hear you thus
speak; but you know that the enterprise which you desire to
undertake is very difficult."</p>

<p>"Sire, it is in difficult and useful enterprises that glory is to
be found. In this castle have taken refuge those who have
pillaged and laid waste a considerable portion of your states,
and they must not remain unpunished. Pardon me if I speak
with more heat than is seemly before my lord and king, but
Rodrigo Diaz would rather break his sword into fragments
than be within a few bow-shots of the Moors and not come to
close quarters with them. Let them but see that we do not
take into consideration whether their walls are strong or weak,
and the terror that will seize on them shall serve us better
than our weapons. The same feeling is widespread amongst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>those under my command, who desire to be the first to prove
to the infidels that there are no Moors capable of resisting
Castilian arms."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Rodrigo, let us attack and conquer this
fortress," replied Don Fernando, full of hope and joy. "Then
let us hasten on to Viseo and other strongholds, and let us not
return to Castile till we have freed Portugal completely from
the Moslem domination."</p>

<p>Preparations were then immediately made for the siege of
the castle. In a few hours it was attacked and defended with
extreme obstinacy. The Moors discharged clouds of projectiles
from the walls, causing terrible carnage amongst the
besiegers. The battering-rams, which the latter worked unweariedly,
did not move a stone, for the walls of Cea were
extremely solid. The Cid, and those under his command,
who fought in the most advanced position, were burning with
impatience, seeing that the time for dashing at the fortress
was delayed so long.</p>

<p>"To the assault! To the assault!" cried the Cid, full of
ardour and courage.</p>

<p>"To the assault!" cried all who were fighting by his side.</p>

<p>But just as they were preparing to put ladders against the
walls, a large portion of one of them crashed down, dislodged
by a terrible blow from a more powerful battering-ram, which
had been constructed when it was found that those which they
had been using were inefficient.</p>

<p>"St. James of Compostela!" thundered the Cid. "To the
walls! To the walls, my good cavaliers!"</p>

<p>And snatching from the hands of its bearer the standard of
Castile and Leon, he clambered up the ruins of the wall, it in
one hand, and his sword in the other, followed by many
cavaliers as brave as himself.</p>

<p>Blood ran in torrents. The Moors fought with desperation,
concentrating almost all their forces on that point; but all was
in vain, for the Cid pressed onward, trampling Moslem corpses
under his feet, and at last gained the highest part of the wall.
There he planted the Christian standard, crying out with
resounding voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cea for Don Fernando!"</p>

<p>This triumph, achieved by the company of the Cid, lent new
courage to the besiegers, and struck terror into the besieged.
In a short time the castle was assaulted at many other places,
and the cross was substituted everywhere for the crescent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
The Castle of St. Martin and others were taken by the army
of Don Fernando shortly after the conquest of Cea. The
name of the Cid resounded in all directions, filling the Moors
with terror; and the brave cavalier, becoming every day more
daring, every day more desirous of seeing the holy cross where
the crescent hitherto dominated, proposed to the king the siege
of Viseo, the only place of importance which the Mahometans
still held in Portugal.</p>

<p>"Sire," said Rodrigo to Don Fernando, "your health and
your age demand quiet and rest after such severe labours. If
a vassal may be allowed to give advice to his lord, I would
counsel you to retire to Coimbra, which is a populous and
rich town, and where you will find, therefore, all the conveniences
and comforts which you have been accustomed to
enjoy in Leon or in Burgos. I am a young man, and therefore
must not let my arm get out of practice. Leave to my
charge the siege and assault of Viseo, and, God aiding me, it
shall be yours within fifteen days."</p>

<p>"It is certain," said Don Fernando, "that my health is
much impaired, and years are coming on me more rapidly
than I should wish. If I were younger, you and I together
would soon drive the Moorish power beyond the Strait into
Africa. My heart, however, beats and grows young again
when I see you fighting. We shall first subjugate Viseo, and
then we shall go together to take some repose in Coimbra,
which place I am desirous to see, as I am fond of it, if it were
only because it cost me a seven-months' siege to subdue it."</p>

<p>"That which pleases you also pleases me, sire," replied
Rodrigo, seeing with joy, and being much moved by, the warlike
ardour which animated the king.</p>

<p>Two days after, the town of Viseo was surrounded.</p>

<p>In vain did the battering-rams exert all their force against
the walls, for they were extremely solid; in vain were ladders
brought up in order to take the castle by assault, for the battlements
were crowded with crossbow-men who rained down their
arrows on all who approached the walls. Three times had the
Cid taken up the standard of Castile and Leon, as at the
escalade of Cea, and had endeavoured to mount the wall; but
each time he had to fall back, seeing those about him killed,
and himself preserved almost miraculously.</p>

<p>It was past midnight. Don Fernando had ordered the
assault to be suspended, in order that he might deliberate with
his captains, and particularly with the Cid, as to the precautions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
that should be taken in order to prevent the sacrifice of so
many men-at-arms, and as to the best means for bringing the
enterprise to a successful issue. They had demanded from
its defenders the surrender of the stronghold, threatening that
all would be put to the sword if they did not deliver themselves
up by a certain day. That day had arrived, and the
besieged still continued to defend it.</p>

<p>A Moor who was one of the sentinels on the battlements
let himself down on the outer side of the wall, and, making
his way to the royal tent of Don Fernando, asked to be
brought into his presence. He was carefully examined, lest
he might have concealed weapons, wherewith to commit
some act of treachery, and, none having been found, he was
brought before the king.</p>

<p>"Sire," he said to Don Fernando, "I believe it is your
intention to take this place by storm and put all the inhabitants
to the sword; I have a wife and children, whom I love,
and in order to save them I have become a traitor to my
faith and to my brothers-in-arms. Many years ago an arrow
was shot from these very walls, which killed Don Alfonso,
King of Leon, and the father of your queen; he who shot
that arrow is now in Viseo. If you give me your word to
spare my wife, my children, and myself, I will tell you who"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Glorious St. Isadore!" exclaimed Don Fernando, "what
do I hear? Can it be possible that the murderer of the
good Don Alfonso&mdash;for whom Queen Sancha still weeps&mdash;yet
lives? Tell me who the traitor is, tell me his name, and I
promise you, not only to spare yourself and your family, but
also to load you with riches."</p>

<p>"Sire," hastened to answer the Moor, filled with joy, "he
is named Ben-Amet, and is now charged with the defence of
the wall of the Mosque; for, as it is it, above all, that should
not fall into your hands, they have confided its defence to him."</p>

<p>"You are now at liberty either to remain here or to return
into the town," said Don Fernando. "To-morrow we shall enter
Viseo; whether you now go or remain with us, describe the
position of your house accurately, and both it and its
occupants shall be respected."</p>

<p>"Opposite the great Mosque there is a detached building
with a handsome frontage; that is my house, sire, and my
wife and children are in it."</p>

<p>The Moor retired to a tent, near that of the king, for he
did not dare to return to the town. Shortly afterwards, Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Fernando summoned his captains and related to them what
he had heard.</p>

<p>"We must," said the Cid, "make the assault at daybreak
on the wall which that traitor defends, and all of us shall
either take it or die in the attempt."</p>

<p>Don Fernando held out his hand to Rodrigo Diaz, rejoiced
to know that he had anticipated his own wish.</p>

<p>"Rodrigo," he said, "you always divine what my heart
feels. Yes, the traitor Ben-Amet must expiate with his blood
that of Don Alfonso; but we must economise as much as
possible our own. We have already lost very many brave
cavaliers in the assaults which we have attempted, and we
must now endeavour to think of some plan to shelter ourselves
to some extent from the arrows of our enemies."</p>

<p>"Our shields," said the Cid, "are not large enough to protect
our bodies from the arrows of the besieged; it seems to me
that it would be a good plan to enlarge them by attaching to
them wooden boards; I heard my father say that such a
thing has been done at times."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the king, "we shall do that."</p>

<p>And as Martin Antolinez, Alvar Minaya, and the other
cavaliers who were present approved, as well as the king, of
the plan of the Cid, whose men were the first that offered to
scale the wall of the Mosque, they began at once to get the
shields enlarged in the manner indicated.</p>

<p>At the dawn of day the Cid and his men approached the
wall of the Mosque as quietly as possible, provided with
scaling ladders and the enlarged shields. At a signal, that
had been arranged beforehand, the ladders were placed against
the walls; the Moors, however, discovered this, and began to
rain down a shower of arrows. The Christian cavaliers, who
preceded the other scalers of the walls, also cast a large
number of javelins, which caused great slaughter amongst the
defenders; however, as the shields protected the bodies of
the besiegers, they did not fall back, but mounted the ladders,
and were very near its summit, notwithstanding the furious
efforts which Ben-Amet and his soldiers used in order to keep
them back.</p>

<p>"St. James of Compostela!" cried the Cid, as at the assault
of Cea; all who followed him repeated the cry with enthusiasm,
and all rushed on to the top of the wall. Then
followed a sanguinary fight; horrible, ferocious, body to body,
arm to arm; dead bodies fell in all directions, blood ran in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
torrents; those who were guarding other portions of the walls
rushed to the defence, but at last the Christian army pressed
forward into the citadel, through the opening made by the
Cid and those under his command, and Ben-Amet was in
the power of Don Fernando.</p>

<p>"Sire," then cried out Rodrigo Diaz, "I ask a favour of
you; enough of blood has already been shed in Viseo, pardon
the vanquished, let not our swords be used against the
defenceless inhabitants of the town."</p>

<p>"I grant your request, good Cid," responded Don Fernando.
"They shall not be used; let no one dare to kill man or
woman."</p>

<p>The soldiers were preparing to put to the sword the inhabitants
of the place, but refrained, respecting the command
of the king.</p>

<p>And then Rodrigo Diaz planted with his own hand the
Christian standard on the walls of Viseo, crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Viseo for Castile and Leon! Viseo for Don Fernando!"</p>

<p>On that same day the hands of the slayer of Don Alfonso
were cut off and his eyes torn out; he then was put to death
with arrows on the very wall from whence he had shot the
regicidal arrow.</p>

<p>The Moors, fearful that Don Fernando would subject the
district over which they still ruled in Portugal, endeavoured
to divert his course, and collecting together a numerous
army, in the direction of Elvas, they marched on through
Estremadura, committing still greater outrages than those
which they had practised in Galicia. Don Fernando learned
this, and although he determined to hasten to stem that
torrent, he considered that he should not leave unprotected
the districts which he had subjected; he resolved, therefore,
to divide his army, with the object that half of it should
remain in Portugal and that the remainder should go in
pursuit of the invaders.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Diaz, to whom inaction was unbearable, for whom
the favourite position was that which offered the most dangers
and fatigues, and who always anticipated the desires of the
king, offered to go in pursuit of the Moors. Don Fernando
accepted his offer, and in a short time the Cid placed himself
at the head of a brave body of men and set out for the
frontiers of Estremadura. The king, in the meantime, well
satisfied with the results of that campaign, and firmly persuaded
that Rodrigo would make the Moors pay dearly for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
temerity, made preparations to visit his dominions in Portugal.
His objects were to assure himself, by personal observation,
of the state of public spirit, of the condition of the fortified
places, of the needs of his subjects; and to put in good order
the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of that kingdom.</p>

<p>The progress of Don Fernando from district to district
presented occasions for the most ardent and sincere ovations
that had been offered to him during his long life. The
Portuguese, who during very many years had groaned under
the heavy Moslem yoke, blessed and honoured with fêtes and
rejoicings the monarch who had liberated them, and in doing
so they also celebrated the glory of Rodrigo.</p>

<p class="center">HOW ONE GOOD MAN CAN MAKE A HUNDRED GOOD ALSO</p></blockquote>


<p>Teresa and Guillen had now been for some days delivered
up to their dreams of love and happiness; it may be said that
those days had liberally indemnified the Infanta for all she
had suffered since the time her mother went to heaven. The
joy of her heart was reflected in her countenance, now as
bright and smiling as it was formerly pale and sad. Her
brother continued to lavish on her assiduous attentions and
endearments, and Guillen also experienced the advantages of
the extraordinary change that could be perceived in the
conduct of the count; a change which, as the reader already
knows, was assumed in order to induce Teresa to obey her
brother when he would make known to her his wish that she
should bestow her hand on the son of the Count of Cabra.
Don Suero was far from suspecting the love which united the
Infanta and the page; he believed that Teresa had an
affection for him, because he was a loyal servant, who amused
her with his pleasant conversation, and who had guarded her,
with fidelity and self-sacrifice, during her captivity amongst
the bandits.</p>

<p>Tidings arrived at Carrion of the victories which the
Castilian and Leonese arms had gained in Portugal, and of
the fact that very many, both nobles and commoners, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
hastening from all quarters to join the army of Don Fernando,
some desirous of glory and others of booty. Guillen then
began to think of his condition, considered that this was the
opportune occasion to endeavour to realise his dreams of
glory and advancement, and decided to leave the service of
Don Suero, in order to take part in the Portuguese hostilities,
however sorrowful the separation between him and the
Infanta might be. He therefore made known his resolution
to Teresa, and she approved of it, feeling that in it lay the
only hope of the realisation of their love. He then went to
inform the count of his intention, determined to carry it out,
whether he gained the approbation of Don Suero or not.</p>

<p>"My lord," he said to him, "the sacrifice even of my life
appears but a small thing to me, if thereby I can repay all
the kindnesses which I have received from you whilst I have
been in your service, and in my present condition all that I
could do to pay that debt would be but trifling. I am
nothing at present, but must become something in the world's
esteem, in order to be of use to your house. The Christian
army is gaining glory and riches in Portugal, and I desire to
have a part in its victories; allow me to depart and enlist
in it."</p>

<p>The Count of Carrion smiled at what he considered the
foolish hopes of the page, and said in a tone of kindly
expostulation&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must be mad, Guillen! Do you imagine that it is
an easy thing for a peasant's son to win the sword and spurs
of a knight by means of sword strokes and lance thrusts, in
an army where such are given, right and left, in abundance?
If such only were necessary, the army of Don Fernando would
soon be one consisting of nothing but knights. Rest content
to be what you are, as your birth prevents you from being
anything higher, and as I am well satisfied with you and
desire to have you with me."</p>

<p>"My lord," replied Guillen, "I know that noble blood does
not run in my veins, but in my breast beats a heart that feels
the ambition of becoming noble. I am still but a youth, and
am resolved to struggle boldly to win the nobility which my
birth denied to me. If I succeed, my rise will be the greater
in proportion to the low condition from which I shall have
raised myself; if I die, I shall at least have gained some
honour in having sacrificed my life for a worthy and noble
ambition."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>The enthusiasm and the ardent desire for advancement
which the page manifested were noted by Don Suero. He
considered that such feelings could indeed make the humble
page very brave. He considered also that Guillen was
grateful to him; he reflected that he, the Count of Carrion,
was in need of friends, for he had not even the friendship of
the neighbouring townspeople and rustics; and, finally, he
came to the conclusion that the youth might be more useful
to him in the army of the Cid than in his own castle.</p>

<p>"Guillen, my good page," he said to him, holding out
his hand affectionately, "you are more honourable than many
who are of noble birth; there is in you the stuff out of which
cavaliers are made; generous sentiments, which I applaud
warmly, animate you. Go then to the wars, and I will nourish
the hope of treating some day as a cavalier him who had been
my servant. I desire that you should bring with you a
memento of him whom you have so loyally served; the
bandits have left me but few horses, but I wish to bestow
on you the best that is in my stables, and also all the arms
you require."</p>

<p>"Thanks, my lord, thanks," murmured the page, forgetting
all the evil deeds of the count, and only seeing the generosity
which Don Suero exhibited towards him at that moment.</p>

<p>"Rodrigo Diaz feels enmity with regard to me," continued
Don Suero, "doubtless because he judges me wrongfully,
as I have been calumniated to him; nevertheless, I cannot
but acknowledge that he is an honourable cavalier and a
very brave soldier. You must enlist in his army, for at
his side you will learn all that is necessary for both a soldier
and a knight."</p>

<p>The page was astonished to hear Don Suero speak thus of
Rodrigo Diaz, whom, up to that time, he had hated, and of
whom he had taken every opportunity to speak badly in every
respect. He considered, however, that, as the feelings of
Don Suero had become so greatly modified regarding the
Infanta, they had also changed with regard to the Cid.</p>

<p>"And when do you think of setting out?" asked the count.</p>

<p>"I should wish to do so this very day, my lord," replied
the page; "for, as I have now obtained your goodwill, I
must arrive in Portugal before the termination of the war
against the Moors, and I do not believe it will last long, to
judge by the valour which, it is reported, the Christian army
is displaying."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, Guillen, perhaps Doña Teresa will have some
message to confide to you; take leave of her, and depart
whenever it suits you."</p>

<p>Guillen went to the apartments of the Infanta, well pleased
with the kindness of the count, but sorrowful because the sad
moment was approaching when he and Teresa should be
separated&mdash;perhaps for ever.</p>

<p>Their parting was indeed like that of the nail from the
flesh, to use the expressive words of a chronicler of the Cid;
and shortly after, Guillen left the Castle of Carrion, mounted
on the spirited steed which Don Suero had presented to him,
and armed with shield and lance.</p>

<p>Just then Bellido Dolfos arrived at the gate of the castle.
Guillen recognised him as one of the captains of the band
of the Vengador, for he had seen him in his camp just before
he and Teresa had set out on their return journey to Carrion,
when the last of the bandits who had been in the power
of Don Suero had arrived. Seeing him now enter the castle
caused, therefore, much surprise to Guillen.</p>

<p>Guillen pursued his way towards Portugal, thinking of
Teresa and building castles in the air. He had been riding
on for about four hours, when, on arriving at a wood, almost
always deserted, as there was neither village nor inn throughout
that district, he thought he heard voices in a thicket.
He listened, and caught the following words&mdash;</p>

<p>"He must be a cavalier, to judge by his horse and arms,
as far as I could take note of them, some way down the
road."</p>

<p>"If he were such he would not travel alone through these
solitudes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has got separated from his followers by
accident in this thick wood."</p>

<p>"Whether he is a cavalier or not, go and advise our chiefs.
I will remain here and keep a close eye on the road. There
may perchance come other men behind him, and 'going for
wool we might return shorn.'"<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"I shall do it at once, comrade."</p>

<p>Guillen looked carefully into the wood, and though there was
no brushwood between the trees he could see nothing. Just,
however, as it occurred to him that the speakers might be concealed
behind the trunk of a tree, he saw a man coming out from
such a position and running towards an adjacent glen; he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>clad almost exactly like those of the band of the Vengador.
Guillen then knew with what kind of people he had to do: the
Vengador was evidently encamped in that wood, and had placed
sentinels on those high trees. He got into readiness his lance
and shield, in case he might be compelled to use them, and
continued his way. Scarcely, however, had he advanced
twenty paces when four horsemen rode forth from the glen,
on a pathway that led from it, and cried out to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Halt, cavalier!"</p>

<p>"I shall do so if you address me more courteously," replied
Guillen, without obeying their order.</p>

<p>"Now we shall use courtesy towards a very daring individual."</p>

<p>And the bandits, for those men did really belong to the
band of the Vengador, rushed on the ex-page, who received
them with the point of his lance.</p>

<p>Guillen defended himself for a considerable time, giving
thrusts, each of which was worth four of those of the aggressors;
in the end, however, thanks to their numerical superiority,
they succeeded in disarming him, and then dragged him off
to the glen.</p>

<p>"You need not fear that we will injure you," said one who
appeared to be the leader. "You have fought like a brave
man, and we, although bandits, are sufficiently honourable
to esteem courageous men as they deserve."</p>

<p>And when he who thus spoke saw the face of Guillen, who
just then threw back his hood, he added&mdash;</p>

<p>"May Beelzebub take me if that face is not known to me!
Confound me! if we have not taken prisoner no other than the
most loyal and attached servitor of the Count of Carrion."</p>

<p>"I have been such, Sir Vengador, or whatever is your
name," replied Guillen; "but henceforth I intend to serve
Don Rodrigo Diaz, or the Cid, as he is now called. In doing
so, I shall also serve Christ and my country, against whose
enemies I am going to fight in Portugal."</p>

<p>"And you will fight well, judging by what we have experienced
from you," said the Vengador. "I cannot understand
how you could have remained so long in the service of
De Carrion, for he is such a wretch that you must have been
very badly treated by him."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, he has always treated me very well; you
see my horse and arms, those are the final proofs of that, for
he made me a present of them. Don Suero was indeed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Don Judas for a long time; but you do not know that of late
he has become quite different."</p>

<p>"Such a conversion astonishes me."</p>

<p>"It is indeed astonishing."</p>

<p>"But I would not trust much in it."</p>

<p>"I trust in it. Do you believe that there are no repentant
sinners in the world?"</p>

<p>"There are such doubtless; but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You who to-day are bandits, might be to-morrow honourable
soldiers."</p>

<p>"Certainly, soldiers and bandits are all fighting men; the
business of both one and the other is killing and plundering."</p>

<p>Guillen, who already considered himself a soldier, was not
very well pleased with this comparison.</p>

<p>"They adopt, however, different modes of killing and
plundering."</p>

<p>"But the certain fact is that they all kill and plunder."</p>

<p>"I am not going to defend, with bandits, the honourable
calling of those who are not such."</p>

<p>"Well, then, if that does not please you, let us talk of
something else. What has become of your lady, that delicate
maiden, whom you took such good care of when in our
camp?"</p>

<p>Guillen, who for a moment had forgotten Teresa, changed
colour when she was mentioned, believing that the bandits
were about to profane her name, mixing it up with some of
their coarse jests.</p>

<p>"Do not speak of her," he said, "for only those who are as
good as she is should have her name in their mouths."</p>

<p>"Do you think that we do not respect those who are really
good? We know that the Infanta is so, and far from saying
anything against her, we would cut out the tongue of anyone
who dared to speak an ill word of her. And as a proof, do
you not remember what we did to a comrade who desired to
take your place with her in the tent?"</p>

<p>Guillen remembered what the Vengador referred to; he
recalled to mind the way in which the chief of the bandits
had acted with regard to Teresa, conduct rather of a good
cavalier than of a bandit; and he experienced in his heart
a feeling of sympathy with the Vengador.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I have not forgotten it; and if you demanded my
life, I would give it for you, on account of the noble way you
treated my lady."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hola! the well-being of the Infanta seems to interest you
much! I would swear that it is not for you a sack of
straw"&mdash;</p>

<p>Guillen coloured up; the Vengador noticed it, and continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"May God preserve me! but it would be a good thing if in
Portugal, by cutting the heads off Moors, you could make
yourself worthy of knighthood and could mount up as easily
as a bubble, so that in the end the Infanta might bestow her
hand on you, in order to efface, with its gentle rubbing, that
cicatrice which was left on yours by the dagger of that fellow
whom I have just mentioned."</p>

<p>A peculiar joy shone on the face of the ex-page, as if these
words, which were so much in harmony with his hopes, were
the prophecy of a saint or of a wizard. The Vengador had
gained a new claim on the confidence of Guillen, for with
whom does a man more sympathise than with him who most
flatters his inclinations? The youth, however, thought that he
should not disclose that pure love of his which he concealed
in his heart at his departure from Castile.</p>

<p>"Such a ridiculous idea," he said, "has never entered my
head. I do love the Infanta, but all love her, because she is
good, because she is kind-hearted, because she is the holiest
of women; I love her, as brothers love their sisters, and I
cannot find any better way to express to you how I love the
Infanta Doña Teresa."</p>

<p>Between a youth and a maiden, not related by the ties of
blood, a tender and pure friendship may exist, but it takes
very little to change it into real love; or rather, such a friendship,
in relation to love, is as the bud to the full-blown rose. The
Vengador knew this from personal experience; he knew, and
the reader knows, if his memory or understanding is not very
weak, and they are almost one and the same thing, a maiden
whom he first loved as a sister, and ended by loving as a
sweetheart; for this reason the last words of Guillen convinced
him more and more that the ex-page was in love with the
Infanta, although he would not give the name of love to his
feelings regarding her.</p>

<p>And it was the fact that, as Martin and Guillen were both
in love, they longed to speak of their love affairs; each was
anxious to make a confidant of someone who could understand
him. Martin had confided to Rui-Venablos his love
for Beatrice, whom he had not seen for a considerable time;
but what did Rui-Venablos understand of love, the rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
soldier who had spent his life on fields of battle, without
feeling affection for anything but his horse and his arms,
and whose ears had never been delighted with more amorous
accents than those of the trumpets which incited him to close
with the Moorish ranks, and to lop off Moorish heads wherewith
to adorn Castilian lances?</p>

<p>"But would it not make you happy to marry Doña Teresa?"
asked the Vengador.</p>

<p>"It would make me happier than to be King of Castile and
Leon," replied the ex-page, scarcely knowing what he was
saying.</p>

<p>Of course Martin had not now the slightest doubt of
Guillen being in love with the Infanta.</p>

<p>The bandits who accompanied the Vengador, when he dismounted,
removed to some distance from the speakers, whilst
their horses went to graze on a sloping bank, covered with
fresh and abundant herbage.</p>

<p>"Go to the glen," said the chief to them, "and hurry on the
meal which we were preparing when we came out to look after
this youth; if I want you meanwhile, I shall send notice to
you."</p>

<p>The bandits took their horses by the bridles, and obeyed
their chief. He and Guillen therefore remained alone, as the
sentinels stationed amongst the trees were too far off to hear
them.</p>

<p>"Then know, my friend," said Martin, "that I have got to
like you since I saw you in the castle of your master on that
accursed night in which we assaulted it, and noticed your
zeal for the interests of the Infanta, and your courage; your
present determination to go to the wars and fight against the
infidels has increased my affection for you. Perhaps you will
learn some day that if I am a bandit by profession, I am not
one by inclination. You love the Infanta; I know it, for it is
impossible to conceal it from me. Learn, then, that I also love
a maiden, who, if she has not noble blood, has a soul as noble
as that of Doña Teresa, and I can make no better comparison.
I am dying to speak of my love with someone who can
understand it; but I have not met with such a person since I
became a member of this band. I know that one of my
companions, named Bellido, is in love with a woman whom he
has now gone to see; but I also know that his heart is not
like that which beats in my breast."</p>

<p>"You say that Bellido loves a woman?" asked Guillen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Martin, remembering that he had seen the traitor entering
the castle.</p>

<p>"Yes, the woman he loves lives on the Burgos road."</p>

<p>"I should rather believe that she lives in the Castle of
Carrion, for I saw him enter it just as I was departing."</p>

<p>"May the anger of God strike him!" exclaimed Martin,
enraged. "Bellido Dolfos at Carrion! The traitor must be
engaged in a plot with the count to destroy the band! My
heart told me that he was a Judas. But are you quite certain
that it was he?"</p>

<p>"As certain as that you are the Vengador," replied Guillen,
beginning to think that the suspicions of the chief of the
bandits were well founded, for he recollected having heard his
companions, the servants of the count, saying that they suspected
there was some understanding between him and
Bellido.</p>

<p>"What a fool I have been!" said Martin, striking his head
with the palm of his hand. "How simple I was not to believe
in the perfidy of men! I always looked on it as a delusion of
that good Rui-Venablos, when he often expressed doubts as to
the fidelity of Bellido."</p>

<p>"You are a greater fool not to abandon the wretched calling
of a bandit," said Guillen, vexed that a young man like the
Vengador should not have a better profession. "Is it possible,
that in times like these, when infidels fight ceaselessly against
the law of Christ, and carry on plunder and murder in your
native land, that a brave, generous, and enamoured youth like
you can be content to remain leader of a band of highway
robbers? I say enamoured, for I cannot understand that,
being so, you should not have the same ambitious aspirations
in your mind that I have in mine."</p>

<p>"I knew well that you were in love with the Infanta," said
Martin, smiling, notwithstanding the vexation and the inquietude
which his suspicions of treachery against Bellido were
causing him.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I do love her," replied Guillen, letting himself
be drawn on by the irresistible confidence which Martin
inspired him with. "I love her, and I know that this secret,
which I confide to you, will die with you; I love her, and I
must either make myself worthy of her, or die in the effort.
What was I before I felt that love, which has raised my
thoughts higher than the flight of the eagles, which soar above
us, touching with their pinions the azure heights of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
heavens? Listen, Sir Vengador, to what I was then. I was a
man who only looked upon the sky to see if the weather was
about to be fair or foul, who only thought of the sun when it
was too burning, or when its heat was pleasant; who only
envied cavaliers because they were better clad and better
mounted than I was; who desired to be rich, because the
wealthy regale themselves with dainty fare and dwell in
luxurious mansions; who saw supreme happiness in a jar of
wine, a loaf of white bread, and a good joint of meat; who in
battle saw no pleasure but in personal revenge, no glory but
in the booty captured from the enemy; who in women saw
nothing but women, confounding the love of a loose wench
with that of a girl really good and affectionate; who, on
seeing laurel crowns and bouquets of flowers thrown to the
soldiers, returning conquerors from the battle, said, 'Why
should those cavaliers feel so proud at having those laurel
crowns and flowers on their brows, when it is so easy to gather
them in the fields of Castile?' Who often asked himself, 'Why
should men trouble themselves about the good or evil which
may be spoken of them after they are dead? What is this
world to those who have ceased to exist? Does not everything
connected with the world die with a man?' Thus was I
then; my soul was as vulgar as that of the commonest of
rustics; but as soon as I began to love the Infanta Doña
Teresa, that noble girl lived constantly in my thoughts, by
day and by night, when I was awake and when I slept. I am
not the same, Sir Vengador. It now delights me at all times
to gaze on the sky, for it seems to me that there, amongst
those white, fleecy clouds floating on its azure transparency, is
the world which the Infanta and I dream of every night; the
sun of March is as delightful to me as that of July, for the sun
is always beautiful, and I adore beauty, wherever it may be
found, since I have learned to adore the Infanta; I desire to
be noble and rich, that my occupations may be noble, in order
to cast no stain on the Infanta with the feelings which cling to
those who drag themselves along the ground; vengeance and
booty appear to me but trifling pleasures in war; the glory of
serving God and Fatherland is that for which I envy the
soldier; it is of it that I am going in search on the battlefields
of Portugal; I see in women something more than women, I
see&mdash;I cannot explain it to you, Sir Vengador, but I see
amongst them beings who resemble angels, beings who resemble
Teresa; love which has not its dwelling-place in the soul is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
disgusting to me, my heart is all love, all tenderness; it seems
to me that one of those crowns with which I have seen the
brows of warriors adorned would make me mad with pleasure;
my reason would almost depart on its touching my forehead;
I would give a hundred lives to win it; I now envy the
happiness of those who, when they die, leave behind them
noble memories which shall never die."</p>

<p>"Young man!" exclaimed Martin, who had listened to
Guillen with enthusiasm and emotion, "give me your hand,
even though that of a man, as honourable as you are, should
not clasp that of a bandit."</p>

<p>"My arms, and not my hand, will I give you," said Guillen,
pressing the Vengador to his breast. "I do not judge men
according as they appear, but according to what they are. I
know not why you have embraced the despicable profession of
a bandit, but I know that the heart of a cavalier beats in your
breast. No, you cannot be a bandit simply for the sake of
killing and plundering, in order to enrich yourself; some desire
for revenge has induced you to adopt the life which you are
leading."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, a revenge it was," replied Martin, with emotion;
"a noble, a holy revenge&mdash;a revenge which I swore over the
dead body of my father, and which I have not yet been able
to accomplish. It was it which armed my right hand with the
dagger of a bandit; it was it which changed Martin, a good,
peaceful, inoffensive youth, living in Carrion, into the terrible
Vengador."</p>

<p>And Martin related his story to Guillen, laid bare his heart
to him, just as it was, with the confidence with which one
brother relates to another, on his return from a long journey,
all that he has gone through, all that he has suffered, all that
he has enjoyed, all that he feels; he then concluded, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you now think that I should abandon the revenge for
which I pant, and for which I have hitherto laboured so
hard?"</p>

<p>"If you abandoned it, far from falling in my esteem, I
would think vastly more of you; for, according to my way of
seeing things, vengeance is always despicable, is always
criminal. However, as custom has sanctified it up to a
certain point, persevere in it for the present; but, in order to
succeed in it, make yourself strong by more noble means than
those of pillage and homicide. If, when you had three
hundred men under your command, you were not able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
revenge yourself on your enemy, how can you expect to do it
now, when you have only forty? What hopes can you have
of increasing your band, when you have got so few to join it,
and have suffered such reverses since that which you experienced
in the Castle of Carrion? You certainly are right,
Martin, in believing that the fear of losing their lives in the
band of the Vengador prevents those from enlisting in it who,
at other times, by their inclinations, and by misery, would be
induced to do so. You know now, moreover, that Bellido is
plotting your destruction, for, without doubt, that and nothing
else brings him to Carrion."</p>

<p>"And what am I to do, Guillen; what can I do in so
critical a situation? Anger of the devil! I, so bold, so
daring, so obstinate, only a short while ago; now so irresolute,
so faint-hearted, so cowardly. What am I to do, Guillen; what
can I do?"</p>

<p>"What are you to do? Does not your heart, perchance,
counsel you; that heart so generous, so noble, so deeply in
love?"</p>

<p>"Since I have heard your words, my heart tells me that it
desires something more than vengeance. The bandit cannot
proudly raise his brow without danger of someone spitting in
his face, and I feel now that I would risk my life to be able to
raise my head like the most honourable men of Castile."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Martin, come with me. Let us go to the
Portuguese campaign, in which they are fighting for God and
native land; there you will be able to wash off, with Moorish
blood, the stain which the world sees on the brow of the
bandit; there you will win power to punish the assassin of
your father; from thence you will return a hundred times
more worthy of being united with that honourable girl whom
you love so much."</p>

<p>"Yes, Guillen, yes, let us go to Portugal, for even now my
heart beats violently, thinking that the time has come when I
can show my courage in more honourable fights than those in
which I have been engaged."</p>

<p>"Good, Martin, good! This enthusiasm tells me that you
will be a valiant soldier," cried Guillen, embracing the bandit
captain.</p>

<p>"Come with me now," said Martin, "as I must inform the
members of the band of my resolution, as they will have to
follow me to Portugal. They are men to whom my will is law,
who, only to free themselves from tyranny and misery, smother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
in their hearts the voice of honour, and bear the infamy which
attaches itself to the life of a bandit. Here, in this glen, is
one half of the band, and the other half is with Rui-Venablos,
round the turn of that hill which you see there in front of
you."</p>

<p>"And do you think that Rui-Venablos will also go with
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you do not know what he is. Rui-Venablos is more
honourable than I am. He joined the band, moved by a disinterested
and noble sentiment. He has been a soldier
almost all his life, and for him happiness is only to be found
on battlefields."</p>

<p>Some hours after, the forty bandits, which now composed the
band of the Vengador, were assembled together in the wood,
all contented with the resolve of their chief. In reality, those
men did not deserve the name of bandits. They had only
revolted against the tyranny of certain nobles, and indeed had
governed themselves more by the laws of war than by those of
vandalism. Admitted, that at the present day they would not
have been received as soldiers into any honourable and loyal
army, still at that period what was required were soldiers ready
to fight against the common enemy, and nobody thought much
of inquiring into their antecedents.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Martin and Guillen took the road that
led to Burgos, for the former desired to go to Vivar to take
leave of Beatrice, whom he had not seen for a considerable
time. Rui-Venablos went on towards Portugal, followed by
the bandits; a place having been decided on beforehand, where
all should meet before their arrival at the frontier.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">IN WHICH THE PROVERB, "LET THE MIRACLE BE WROUGHT,
EVEN THOUGH THE DEVIL DOES IT," IS JUSTIFIED</p></blockquote>


<p>The Cid was burning with impatience to overtake the Moors,
who were ravaging Estremadura. They were committing more
outrages than ever before, for they had not invaded the states
of Don Fernando on any former occasion with so much im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>petuosity
and ferocity. Rodrigo saw with the eyes of his
soul all their barbarities; he saw the harvests cut down and
burned, the flocks stolen, churches and private dwellings
sacked, some of the inhabitants inhumanly butchered, and
others, even more unfortunate, taken captive and savagely
maltreated; he saw those who were still free raising their
hands to heaven and imploring God for mercy, beseeching
Him to send a warrior who might chastise those savage
invaders; an angel who, with his flaming sword, might exterminate
those barbarous and impious men, who looked on
nothing as sacred. And the brave and noble heart of the
Castilian leader bled for the sufferings of those unfortunate
people. The Cid crossed the frontier of Estremadura, at
the head of his valorous army, filled with joy as if he were
entering the Promised Land. On all sides his eyes saw the
marks of fire and blood which the infidels had left on their
track. Rapidly, however, as the Castilian army marched on,
they could not discover the infidels, and Rodrigo and his
men were filled with fury, seeing that all their diligence was
in vain.</p>

<p>The Moors had learned that the invincible Christian army
was advancing on them; to return to Portugal was the same
as to go straight to meet them; to proceed towards the
kingdom of Toledo was to expose themselves to be driven
back from the frontier, for they knew that Almenon would
not wish to lose the friendship of Don Fernando by admitting
them into his dominions. The only thing that was open to
them was to proceed straight on, pass through the centre of
Castile and cross the Moncayo, with the object of taking
refuge in some one of the many small Moorish states into
which Aragon was then divided; they adopted, therefore, that
latter course, and continued their march into the interior of
Castile, increasing on their way the stores of rich booty which
they had taken in Estremadura. As they were, however, a
day's march in advance of the Cid, it was not possible for
him to overtake them as soon as he desired. Both armies,
however, were now in Castile; and Rodrigo, fearing that the
Moors might be able to carry out their intention of getting
into Aragon before he could overtake them, determined to
make a final effort, an almost superhuman one, in order to
fall on them and wrench from them the numerous captives
whom they were carrying off, and punish their audacity and
their cruelties. At last he overtook them, between Atienza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
and San Esteban de Gormaz, and a battle commenced, furious
on both sides.</p>

<p>The army of the Cid, though having the advantage in
valour, was less numerous than that of the enemy; however,
the circumstance of their being on their native soil, and their
courage, which had been increased by their efforts for so
long a time to attack the invaders, were elements which were
much in their favour. The Moors resolved to defend their
booty at all costs, for it was so valuable that they would
leave nothing undone in order to retain it. The Castilian
squadrons threw themselves several times against the infidels,
but were each time repulsed, with heavy loss on both sides.
The Cid was always in the very front, spurring on his steed
to close with his adversaries, and at his side could be seen
Fernan, although to keep up with Babieca, which flew at
the slightest touch of the spur, he had almost to flay the
sides of Overo.</p>

<p>"On, on! St. James of Compostela!" cried the Cid, burning
with anger at seeing the impotence of all his efforts, and preparing
for a fresh charge. "We shall all die on those fields
of our native land rather than lose the name of Invincibles
which Castile has given us, for it is better to die fighting
than to live flying. Do you not hear, cavaliers, those lamentations
which rise from the enemies' camp? They come from
the unhappy Christians whom those infidels drag on with
them, loaded with chains and trampled under the hoofs of
their chargers. We are their only hope; they trust in us,
they call down on our heads the blessing of God, as we
have come to fight bravely for them in order to save them
from captivity, and they should justly curse us if they saw
us turning back like cowards. We conquered in Portugal,
shall we be defeated in Castile&mdash;in Castile, where the ashes
of our brave forefathers repose, where the eyes of a mother,
of a wife, or of a beloved maiden look upon our deeds?
Onward, cavaliers! follow me, conquer or die with me; for
I will conquer, or die as a brave man!"</p>

<p>When he had pronounced those last words the Cid rushed
on the enemy, and with him all his cavaliers, shouting
enthusiastically, proving the influence which the words and
the example of their brave leader exercised on those sturdy
warriors.</p>

<p>The hostile army was divided into two bodies, stationed
within ten crossbow-shots of each other. At the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
both were attacked by the Christians, whose squadrons got
separated when the charge was made; the Cid closing with
the Moors to the right, whilst Martin Antolinez, to whom he
had confided his standard, attacked those on the left. Both
bodies received the Christians with the points of their lances
and the keen edges of their cimeters; the division attacked
by the Cid was not able to resist the charge, and took to
flight in the greatest disorder, followed and cut down by
the Castilians.</p>

<p>The Cid and his followers had already disappeared in the
distance, pursuing the enemy, blinded by fury and desirous of
exterminating them, and as yet Martin Antolinez had not
succeeded in breaking the Moorish squadron, which was
stationed to the left. The fight was becoming every moment
more obstinate and bloody, and its result was becoming more
and more doubtful. The soldiers of Antolinez, instead of
gaining ground were rather losing it, as the Moors, seeing
themselves deprived of all chance of aid, were now fighting
with the desperation of those who, having lost all hope of
saving themselves, desire to savour death with the pleasure of
vengeance. The Christians, rendered more courageous by that
strenuous resistance, broke at last into the midst of their
enemies, without thinking of the risk of such an undertaking,
and then the Moors, availing themselves of a rapid and skilful
piece of strategy, surrounded them on all sides, and the conflict
became still more furious. The Christians were horribly
cut up by the sword strokes, and all their strength was vainly
expended against that circle of hostile lances which encircled
them, and which was closing round them closer and closer
each moment; hope of escape was scarcely left to them, and
the green standard of the Cid would soon be in the hands of
his foes, although Martin Antolinez, who held it aloft in one
hand, whilst he brandished his sword with the other, cutting
down an enemy at each stroke, was resolved to save it or to
die under its shadow. Fatigue and want of breath was beginning
to tell on the Christian cavaliers. Antolinez cast from
time to time a rapid glance across the plain to see if assistance
of any kind was coming to them; the plain, however, was
deserted, and he only could see the line of corpses which the
Moors, pursued by the Cid, were leaving behind them, and
several captives who had succeeded in escaping from their
captors during the battle. Those were wandering about, still
manacled and uncertain as to the fate which might befall them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
A multitude of his enemies composed the circle around
Antolinez, attacking him with fury, endeavouring to capture
the standard. The brave man of Burgos defended himself with
the most stubborn courage, but his blood was staining the
equipments of his horse; Alvar, Fañez Minaya, and other
cavaliers were fighting vainly to free him from his enemies.</p>

<p>"Cowards!" cried out Antolinez to the Moors. "A brave
deed, forsooth, is yours&mdash;twenty of you to attack one cavalier!
Fight with me, not one against one, but four against one, and
you will see whether my sword pierce not your hearts, e'er you
shall drag from my hand the standard of my Cid!"</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he showered furious blows on his enemies,
the number of whom was increasing every moment. At last
a cimeter struck the arm which held up the standard, and it
fell from his hand notwithstanding all the efforts he made to
retain it, for the cut was terrible. The despair of Antolinez
then reached its height: the good cavalier, rendered incapable
of guiding his steed, spurred it on furiously and dashed into the
midst of the enemy, making a bloody opening through them.</p>

<p>But behold, when the Castilians were almost completely
vanquished, a loud cry was heard in the distance, and about
fifty horsemen were seen rushing towards the combat with the
fleetness of the wind.</p>

<p>"St. James! St. James!" they shouted, and that cry was
full of terror for the Moors, and full of hope for Martin
Antolinez and his men.</p>

<p>Who are those who thus come to the aid of the Christians?
They cannot be the squadron of the Campeador, for it is
pursuing the Moors in the direction opposite to that from
which those horsemen appear. Behold them, behold them
already at the place of combat: two handsome youths and a
man of colossal stature, and evidently of great strength, lead
the band.</p>

<p>Justice of God! with what fury they rush into the midst of
the Moors, throw them into confusion, and scatter them in all
directions! What fierce cuts and thrusts they give! How the
dead bodies of the Moslems roll upon the ground!</p>

<p>"Cavaliers, whoever you are, to me, to me! Rescue the
standard of the Campeador, which these cowards have torn
from my grasp!" cried Martin Antolinez, addressing the
leaders of the newly-arrived combatants.</p>

<p>"We will all die or save it," cried Guillen, for it was he, with
Martin, Rui-Venablos, and all the bandits who composed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
band of the Vengador, that had arrived fortunately before it
was too late, to the aid of Martin Antolinez and his soldiers.</p>

<p>And whilst Martin and Rui-Venablos continued to fight
like lions in the thick of the hostile force, Guillen rushed like
lightning against the Moorish horseman who had succeeded in
capturing the green standard of the Cid, and who was holding
and defending it tenaciously. His lance caused great slaughter
amongst the enemy, who endeavoured to avoid his thrusts, and
soon were thrown into disorder: the Moor, however, who had
wounded Antolinez and taken the standard from him, would
not yield up that inestimable prize, the acquiring of which had
been so difficult; he fought front to front with Guillen, and to
judge by the fury of the combat, one or other must soon cease
to exist. Blow followed blow with fearful rapidity, and both
combatants were wounded more or less severely.</p>

<p>"St. James! St. James to my aid!" shouted Guillen, grasping
his lance with desperate force, and making so furious a
thrust at his enemy that he fell from his horse pierced through
the breast. The youth dragged from him the standard which,
even when falling dead, he still held convulsively clutched in
his hand, and, raising it aloft and waving it gallantly above his
head, cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Victory! victory! St. James!"</p>

<p>When they saw the standard rescued, the Castilian soldiers
felt their strength redoubled, and in a few minutes the Moslem
squadron was flying before them.</p>

<p>However, as it was numerous, some hundreds of horse
soldiers succeeded in escaping from the field of battle,
abandoning what remained to them of the rich booty which
they had seized on their long march.</p>

<p>The Christians dashed on in their pursuit, guided by the
standard of the Cid which Guillen waved in the van, and as
the Moors fled they left behind a very large number of their
dead, for the Castilians came up with them from time to time
and cut them down without mercy.</p>

<p>The soldiers of Martin Antolinez had pursued the Moors
for about half an hour, when they perceived in the distance
the Cid, who was returning to the assistance of his men, when
he had finished with that division of the enemy in pursuit of
which he had gone. All the Castilian forces were soon
reunited, and the entire army continued the pursuit for more
than seven leagues, until the Moorish army was completely
destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely a Moor escaped the Castilian steel; that formidable
Moslem army which, haughty and devastating, had penetrated
into Estremadura and overrun all Castile, ceased to exist
before they could reach Aragon, and the Cid and his
cavaliers made themselves masters of the very rich spoils
which they were bearing away with them.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Rodrigo rejoined the division commanded by
Martin Antolinez when his attention was called to the band
of the Vengador, and especially to the youth who was bearing
his standard; but as it was then incumbent on him to
continue the pursuit of the Moors, he postponed, till that was
ended, the obtaining of information as to what had happened,
and as to who those soldiers were who had exhibited such
bravery in the fight.</p>

<p>Therefore, as soon as the Castilian army had finished with
the Moors and collected the spoils together, he sat down to
take the rest of which he was so much in need, and Martin
Antolinez and other cavaliers, who were in his company at
the commencement of the combat, related to the Cid all that
had taken place. Martin Antolinez, who cared only for his
wound because it prevented him from using his sword, told
his leader that his soldiers were on the point of yielding and
abandoning the standard when the unknown band arrived to
their aid; he narrated to him the valour and the dexterity with
which those men, especially their captains, had fought, and
finally the heroic efforts by which that youth, whose name he
was ignorant of, had rescued the standard.</p>

<p>Rodrigo advanced towards Guillen, the Vengador, and Rui-Venablos,
and opened his arms to them, filled with enthusiasm
and gratitude.</p>

<p>"You have saved my standard," he said to the former, "and all
the treasures of the world would appear too small a recompense
for so great a service."</p>

<p>"My lord," answered Guillen, much moved, and feeling his
heart throb with joy, for he was beginning to realise the hopes
of glory of which he had dreamed for so long a time, "the
service you mention merits no reward, for every soldier should
do his duty, and I have done no more than accomplish mine.
For good men it is a sufficient recompense to know that they
have served God and their native land; but if the rescue
from the infidels of your glorious standard merits a greater
reward than that which I have mentioned, pay it to me by
granting me the honour of being one of your soldiers, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
fight in your army and by your side against the Moorish
power."</p>

<p>"I shall consider myself much honoured if you and
your companions will aid me in this war. You shall be my
friends, my brothers-in-arms. In my heart, which the
sanguinary scenes of battlefields cannot move, there is a
space, by no means small, destined for gratitude and sweet
friendship; in that space you will always occupy one of the
chief positions."</p>

<p>Guillen, Martin, and Rui-Venablos listened with moist eyes
to that noble cavalier, to that valiant leader, who won hearts
with a single word, for in that word was manifested the most
generous and best soul that could animate a man.</p>

<p>Guillen, Martin, and Rui-Venablos felt it their duty not to
conceal their antecedents from Rodrigo Diaz, for he was
sufficiently just to do justice to those who had it on their side,
sufficiently sensible not to let himself be borne away by vulgar
prejudices, and sufficiently clear-sighted to understand the
motives by which men were animated. For these reasons it
appeared to them a treason, which their consciences could not
tolerate, were they to present themselves to that cavalier, so
loyal, so kind, and so sincere, otherwise than as they had
really been.</p>

<p>A curious observer could not fail to have taken note of an
animated discussion which took place on the following day
amongst Fernan Cardeña, Alvar, Lope, and other pages and
squires, whilst the army of the Cid was marching towards
Burgos, in the midst of the noisiest and most enthusiastic
ovations of the Castilian people; these were more ardent even
than those of which they were the objects on their return from
the battle of the mountains of Oca. That discussion was
very curious and so connected with the objects we have in
view that we think it well to insert it on our pages.</p>

<p>"I say to you, Fernan," said Alvar, "that if I were as old
as you are, if I had the prizes you have won in this campaign,
and a wife to marry as good and loving as Mayorica is, I vow
to God that I would wed her as soon as I got back to Burgos,
and give up at once the profession of arms."</p>

<p>"I swear, by the soul of Beelzebub, that you deserve a gag
in your mouth, to keep you from talking such nonsense.
Give up at once the profession of arms? Is it not an
honourable one, perchance?"</p>

<p>"Honourable, I admit, but thankless and severe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"It may be so for those who possess your mean disposition,
but not for those who love glory and advancement."</p>

<p>"And what do you understand by glory, Fernan?"</p>

<p>"I vow by Judas Iscariot that the question of this fool
pleases me. What do I understand by glory? I understand
by it, sleeping in camps; awaking to the noise of the trumpets
and drums which sound the alarm; listening to the neighing
of the chargers, impatient to rush on the enemy; giving sword
slashes to the Moors; and seeing the heads of foemen fall
about, as ripe fruit falls from the trees when a brisk breeze
blows. That, and nothing else, is real glory, brother, and the
son of my mother would not exchange it for all other kinds of
glory in the world, even that of marrying girls as handsome
and loving as Mayorica."</p>

<p>"However, comrade," said Lope, the discreet squire, who
on another occasion gave two salutary pieces of advice to
Fernan on the subject of love, "one could continue to exercise
the honourable profession of arms, and still have a wife and
children; I have such myself, and nevertheless have not
abandoned arms, as you see. Alvar is right in recommending
you to marry Mayor, now that you have means enough to
support her."</p>

<p>"Whether I marry or don't marry, as long as there remain
Moors for my master Don Rodrigo to fight against, I will not
give up my lance."</p>

<p>"But don't you love Mayorica?"</p>

<p>"I love her, and will continue to love her with all my soul.
Oh, how I long to arrive at Burgos, to see her after so long a
separation!"</p>

<p>"Now I see," replied Lope, "that you are begging the
question as to whether you will marry her or not."</p>

<p>"I am indeed thinking of marrying, but it is an unfair thing
to have to bind oneself before God to love only one woman,
considering that there are two or even more for every man."</p>

<p>"Leave aside all that nonsense, comrade, for it sounds badly
coming from a man so ripe in years as you are. To think as
you think should be only for beardless youths, such as he who
yesterday rescued the standard of Don Rodrigo, and I am of
opinion that even he would not talk of love with as little sense
as you display in the matter."</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Alvar, "that I look on the friendship
and honours which Don Rodrigo confers on that youth as
signs of mere craziness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Craziness?" cried Fernan, whose anger was aroused on
hearing the page find fault with his master. "The craziness,
which deserves more stripes than you have hairs on your head,
is your own, you confounded fool and chatterbox. All that
Don Rodrigo does is well done."</p>

<p>"I only meant to say that nobody knows in the least who
that young man is; and as to his companions, everybody
knows, for they tell it themselves, that they are the band of
the Vengador."</p>

<p>"'Let the miracle be wrought, even though the devil does it.'
The certain thing is, that only for that youth and those who
accompanied him to aid us, the squadron of Martin Antolinez
would have been completely routed, and the standard of Don
Rodrigo would be now in the hands of the infidels. I swear
by Judas Iscariot, that if the Cid, my master, had lost his
standard, he would have either died of grief and despair, or
else have pursued the infidels to the ends of the world in order
to recapture it."</p>

<p>"How much soever they may have extolled to you the
valour of that Guillen, whoever he may be, of that Martin, and
of that giant who bears the name of Rui-Venablos, and of all
their men," said Lope, "it is nothing to what they deserve.
I happened to be amongst the soldiers of Martin Antolinez,
and thanks to that, I know exactly to what extent those men
deserve the recompenses which the Campeador has bestowed
on them, and promised to bestow on them."</p>

<p>"Well, tell us, then, what recompenses they have received?"
asked Alvar.</p>

<p>"He has given," answered Fernan, "double as much of the
spoils to each of them as to the other men in the army; and
he has promised Guillen, who is of peasant origin, like Martin
and Rui, that he will be knighted in Burgos. You need not
imagine, moreover, that Don Rodrigo will allow these men-at-arms
to leave his side, for he has taken them into his
pay."</p>

<p>"Anger of God!" exclaimed Alvar, "with what a lucky
foot this Guillen has walked into the profession of arms!"</p>

<p>"And I have heard that our master, who never makes a
mistake, has said that Guillen will be in a short time one of
his best captains."</p>

<p>"He will be an emperor if our master goes on thus lavishing
favours on him, for some men are born feet foremost and
others head foremost, and he must be of the former."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you cursed charlatan, how envious you are!" said
Fernan. "The good fortune of another man enrages you, no
matter how well merited it may be. I suppose you would like
to be made a knight? I tell you, Alvar, that if I ever hear you
say a word against Guillen, or any of those who have joined
the army with him, I'll break your ribs with a cudgel. It is
my duty to defend that youth; only for him the son of my
mother would be now lying, food for wild beasts, on the field
of battle where we defeated the Moors yesterday."</p>

<p>"Relate to us, Fernan, what happened to you," said Alvar;
"for I should like to go slow for a while, as my horse is very
much fatigued."</p>

<p>"Don't lay the blame of your falling back on your horse, as
it is the fault of your own cowardly heart," replied Don
Rodrigo's squire. "There is no chance of your scarifying
very seriously the flanks of your charger whenever you shall
be required to rush on the enemy."</p>

<p>"Comrade, I say of myself what you said of Overo a short
time before you sallied forth from Burgos to proceed to
Compostela, 'everyone is just as God made him, and faults
should not be punished which one brings from the womb of
his mother.' But won't you recount to us what happened to
you yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I shall do so at once. Don Rodrigo, Guillen, and I were
fighting, with more than usual fury, against five Moorish
cavaliers, who formed an impenetrable wall before us. At
last we succeeded in breaking through them and throwing
them into disorder. Don Rodrigo rushed in pursuit of three
of them who had fled, and who appeared to be men of rank,
whilst Guillen and I remained fighting with the others, who, to
give them their due, were much braver than their companions,
as they did not seek safety in flight. He who was fighting
with me gave so fierce a lance thrust that, striking the pommel
of the saddle, the shock threw down Overo, and I found
myself on the ground, incapable of defending myself. The
Moor was already aiming his lance at me, to fix me to the
earth, when Guillen, who saw what was going on, rushed to
my aid, overthrew the Moor, my antagonist, with his lance,
and returning to him whom he had just left, and who was
taking to flight, he pierced him through the breast. Now you
see that, were it not for that brave youth, the weakness of
my horse would have cost me my life."</p>

<p>"Oh, what triumphs you achieve with that high-spirited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Overo!" said Alvar, laughing, which made Fernan very
angry.</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub, if you laugh at my mishaps, it
will cost you dear, Alvar. As to my horse, I swear that if he
ever again treats me so, he shall atone for his fault where he
commits it, by being left there as the prey of wild beasts."</p>

<p>"You always say that, Fernan; if I were your horse I would
laugh at your threats."</p>

<p>"You will see if he laughs the next time he acts in such a
manner."</p>

<p>Just as Fernan thus spoke, a bull ran from a herd which was
grazing in a field beside the road, and rushed on the pages and
squires with a fury such as is seldom seen. All were trying to
get out of his way, surprised by such a sudden attack, except
Fernan, who, pulling at the reins of Overo, and preparing his
lance, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cowards! Do you fly from this miserable beast? You
will see, I vow to Judas Iscariot, that my lance shall soon
bring down his pride."</p>

<p>And thus speaking, he directed his steed in the direction of
the bull.</p>

<p>The latter gave a furious bellow, and rushed on him who
had thus challenged him. The lance of Fernan struck one of
the flanks of the bull, but glanced off it; the animal charged
Overo fiercely, and he fell, together with his rider, rolling down
a very steep declivity, so that all believed that both of them
were killed.</p>

<p>The bull continued to do considerable damage to the squires,
none of whom were able to restrain him, although they did
their best, having recovered from the confusion which his first
charge had caused amongst them.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Diaz, as well as the cavaliers who were conversing
with him, noticed the tumult which had just arisen, and, as
soon as he learned the cause of it, seized his lance, and turning
back, guided Babieca towards the bull. The first victory won
by the animal seemed to have increased his ferocity. He
rushed madly at the cavalier who was approaching him, but
the lance of the Cid buried itself in his head, as deep as its
steel head was long.</p>

<p>The bull gave a terrible roar, and fell lifeless on the ground.
In the meantime, Fernan and his steed were brought up from
the hollow into which they had fallen, without more damage
than a few, not very serious, bruises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you much injured, Fernan?" hastened to ask all his
companions.</p>

<p>"No," answered Fernan; "only bruised, but no bones
broken. Leave me, by the soul of Beelzebub! leave me, and
go see if Overo has a wound on his head."</p>

<p>When he was told that Overo had received no hurt of any
consequence, joy appeared on his countenance, and he
hastened to mount him again, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am always unlucky with that horse. Many, many indeed,
Overo, are the mishaps thou hast caused me, but if thou
actest so again thou shalt pay for it with thy skin."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">IN WHICH IT IS PROVED THAT HE WHO SOWS REAPS, AND IN
WHICH IT IS SEEN THAT THEY WHO GIVE RECEIVE.</p></blockquote>


<p>The sun had not yet risen in the east when Ximena was
standing at a window from which could be seen the road, which
Rodrigo and his knights had taken when going on their
pilgrimage to Compostela. An unusual joy animated her
countenance, and her gaze did not wander from that road on
which she had seen her noble and beloved husband departing,
and by which she hoped to see him returning on that very
day.</p>

<p>On that day, indeed, he was expected in Burgos, the city of
his ancestors, and Ximena, who, after the receipt of such good
news, had not been able to sleep during the night, arose at
dawn, and placed herself at the window of her apartment,
desirous that her eyes might be the first to see Rodrigo enter
Burgos. It is a common opinion that a young woman does not
look on a husband with the same eyes as on a lover, that
for her has disappeared the golden halo which surrounded
him, the inexplicable mystery which had presented him to her
as a being distinct from all other beings. Ximena, however,
gave a contradiction to that opinion, and every wife who has a
soul like hers, who has gone to the altar impelled, not by an
artificial love, but by an affection which has been insensibly
identifying itself with the soul, becoming part of it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
acquiring its immortal principle. When love is essentially
pure, and refined by the various trials which Ximena had
passed through; when it is the thought of one's entire life;
when in it is to be found the sole hope and the sole happiness
of this world; when its object is so worthy of being beloved as
Rodrigo was, then love never loses its enchantment, its
mystery, its poetry; it becomes even more beautiful with full
possession, more complete in every way. Sermonda, as the
Limosin chronicles relate, went one day to her window and
saw Raimundo de Castel mounted on a fiery steed, completely
covered with white armour, and bearing as his device these
words: "<i>Mi corazon está libre y desea ser cautivo</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Sermonda was a maiden of ardent heart, of fantastic
imagination, and passionately fond of the love romances of the
troubadours and minstrels, especially those of Guillermo de
Cabestañ, the sweetest troubadour of Provence. She fell in
love with Raimundo de Castel, for in him she saw one of those
valiant and enamoured cavaliers whom the good Guillermo
described in his lays of love, and married him shortly afterwards.
Much time had not elapsed when her love had changed
to indifference; in a short time Raimundo had lost in the
eyes of Sermonda the aureole of love and poesy which had
surrounded him; before long she happened to meet the
gentle troubadour Guillermo de Cabestañ, and loved him
madly. Raimundo found this out, killed the troubadour,
caused his heart to be fried and served up to his faithless
spouse. When she discovered that she had eaten the heart of her
lover, she told her husband that she had never tasted more
delicious food, and then threw herself from the window. This
is the kind of love which degenerates, which vulgarises itself
by intimate and continuous intercourse, a love which has no
hold on the soul, for the love of Sermonda was that of the
imagination, not that of the heart. The love of Ximena was
that love which is almost born with us, which increases in us,
which lives with our life; and that is the love which, instead
of becoming weaker, gains strength, preserves always its
primitive freshness, mystery, and poesy, and which is as
immortal as the soul to which it has clung.</p>

<p>Who is there that has not passed a night feeling somewhat
as Ximena did during that which preceded the day of the
return of her husband? Who is there who has not sometimes
lost a night's repose for the hope of seeing a beloved being on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>the following day, has not in vain endeavoured to call down
sleep on his eyelids, has not counted the hours one by one,
and has not several times thought that the light of the moon,
feebly penetrating into the room, was the early dawn? And
did not that night seem three times as long as usual, on
account of her having passed it thinking on him who was
expected, seeing him in thought, pondering over the first words
that would be heard from his lips, guessing at the costume he
would wear, calculating when they would meet each other, and
even considering what effect that meeting would have on the
countenance of him who was about to return home?</p>

<p>He who has found himself in that position, he who has
experienced anything like this, will understand how long that
night must have seemed to Ximena; how sweet the singing of
the birds must have sounded to her ears on that morning;
with what joy she had saluted the day; how excited her heart
must have felt, and with what intentness her eyes must have
been fixed on the road by which Rodrigo was to arrive. The
hope, however, of seeing again her absent husband, her beloved
one, the valiant knight, the hero returning with his brows
crowned with laurels, was not the only thing which caused
Ximena to feel so happy.</p>

<p>She had good news to communicate to Rodrigo; he was
about to find in his sweet and loving wife a new title to his
love, a new pledge of her affection, for the breast of Ximena
enclosed the first-fruit of that love which had filled up almost
the entire lives of both of them&mdash;she was about to become
a mother. What new and exceeding sweet enchantments
must she not have experienced from the time she had become
aware of that happiness! The wife is then something more
than a woman, she has something of the divine, something
which separates her from weak humanity; then surrounds her
brow a holy aureole, which eyes cannot see, but which the
soul distinctly perceives,&mdash;a husband must then have a worthless
soul and a flinty heart, not to respect her, adore her,
bless her! For love has now rendered its work complete,
combining matter in the same way as spirit had been combined;
for the wife could say to the husband, on feeling the
pains of maternity, "Behold, to thee am I indebted for these
pains"; for the wife is then a being the most tortured, and the
most in need of tender care; for the husband then sees in
that woman a mother, a mother such as she who had carried
himself in her breast, fed him with her milk, taught him to lisp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
his first words, to walk his first steps, and who dried his tears
with her kisses.</p>

<p>"My husband, a being, a small part of ourselves, moves in
my breast."</p>

<p>Should not these words sound very sweet to the ears of the
husband who, for the first time, is about to receive the name
of father? How sweet must they not sound when they come
from the lips of an idolised woman, of a woman whose love he
believes to be sufficient to abundantly compensate for all
trials, all deceptions, all miseries, all sadnesses, all injustices,
all physical pain, all the misfortunes of life! How pleasing,
how consoling must not the hopes of paternity be! At first,
beautiful children, with complexions like the lily and the rose,
with golden hair like that of the angels, who, with smiles on
their lips, throw their tender arms around those who have
given them their being, as if they were endeavouring to pay the
debt of their existence with kisses and innocent caresses;
afterwards, gentle youths and maidens, whose ardent hearts are
agitated by the generous instincts and noble aspirations of early
life, in whom the parents look upon the pictures of themselves,
with the same pleasure as the old man looks upon his portrait
which, when young, he presented to the maiden of his love,
and which she restored to him on the day when they went to
live under the same roof. Such, in short, are the hopes which
should be awakened in the heart of a husband when his wife
tells him that she is about to become a mother.</p>

<p>How sad must be the life of married people whose heads
become white, whose limbs become weak, and in whose ears
the name of father or mother does not sound! Feel compassion
for those spouses who around their hearths see none
to whom they can give the title of child; for old people feel
the need of children as much as children do of parents; old
age requires a staff on which to lean; for death is doubly
painful when all goes with ourselves to the churchyard, when
no eyes remain to water the flowers placed on our tombs.</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts which passed through the mind of
Ximena during that night. She knew that Rodrigo would
think in the same way; she knew that the news she was
about to impart to her beloved husband would be the sweetest
he could listen to; she knew that an additional bond, as firm,
as indissoluble, as holy as those which already united them,
would soon draw them even more closely together, and her heart
leaped with joy, and tears of happiness flowed from her eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
and she blessed God who had thus increased her felicity, when
the being whom she felt in her breast reminded her that
Rodrigo, when clasping her in his arms, would embrace two
dear ones at the same time.</p>

<p>She, however, was not the only one who had her eyes fixed
on that road: those of Teresa and Diego, and also those of
Mayor, Lambra, and Gil, were looking in the same direction;
besides these, all the inhabitants of Burgos were anxiously
expecting the arrival of the victorious leader. Happy are the
absent who know that they are expected at the domestic
hearth with such great love, impatience, and anxiety!</p>

<p>At last, a dark moving mass was perceived on the white road,
which disappeared towards the distant horizon. Numerous
cries of joy resounded at the same time from the windows of
the house of the lords of Vivar, and shortly afterwards Rodrigo
and his escort dismounted at its door. To describe the joy,
the caresses, the tears, the embraces, with which his family
welcomed the victorious cavalier would be as difficult as to
express with words all the joys, enchantments, mutual pleasures,
and sweet confidences which the unwritten and undescribable
history of domestic life contains.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Diaz, who on the field of battle mowed down
Moslem heads as the reaper cuts down the harvest in his fields;
who, at the assault of a fortress, rushed against its walls,
trampling dead bodies under foot, and covered with blood;
the terrible warrior whose name alone filled the ferocious
Islamites with terror; that man of iron, who seemed born only
to live in combats&mdash;that man, we repeat, was at the domestic
hearth the personification of mildness, of love, and of simplicity.
If he could be seen clasping his parents and his wife to his
heart, with tears of happiness in his eyes; if he could be seen,
as excited as a child, blessing God and Ximena, when he
learned that she bore the first-fruit of their love within her
breast; if he could be seen conversing with his servants with
the same kindness as if they were his equals; and, finally,
caressing Gil, the Moorish child, whom he had taken under his
protection, and amusing him with the same playfulness and
boyishness as he had displayed at the period when he sported
with Ximena at the Castle of Vivar, and imprinted a kiss for
the first time on the lips of the innocent little girl; if all this
could have been seen, he would have been admired more
under the domestic roof than on the fields of battle.</p>

<p>Three days after the return of the Cid to Burgos, on a calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and beautiful morning, like another which he remembered
with joy, for it had been the happiest of his life, that on which
he had first called Ximena by the sweet name of wife, a great
multitude crowded round the gates of the church of Santa
Gadea, and many ladies and cavaliers entered it.</p>

<p>On that morning the order of knighthood was to be conferred
on Guillen by the hand of the Cid Campeador, and the
noble Ximena was to buckle on the golden spur.</p>

<p>The brave youth had kept vigil over his arms, during the
preceding night, before the altar, and was awaiting with
impatience the solemn ceremony, when he would receive the
sword-stroke on his shoulder, when the golden spur would be
buckled on, and when he would be girt with his knightly sword.</p>

<p>And the time at last arrived.</p>

<p>The church was decorated with the Moslem standards,
which, from time immemorial, the cavaliers of Burgos had
deposited in it, on their return from the wars, as a just and
holy homage to the God of battles. Torrents of light spread
themselves about in all directions, incense filled the nave of
the church, and sacred chants sounded in harmony with the
peals of the bells.</p>

<p>"The Lord," sang the priests and the congregation, "has
broken the bows, the shields, and the swords of our enemies,
and put an end to the war."</p>

<p>"O Lord! Thou hast shed down upon us the rays of Thy
goodness, whilst Thou hast filled our enemies with fear."</p>

<p>"Who, O Lord, can resist Thy anger?"</p>

<p>"Seated on Thy heavenly throne, Thou hast decreed the
salvation of Thy people, and peace has succeeded to war."</p>

<p>"The universe praises Thee, and blesses Thee, and sings
the glory of Thy name."</p>

<p>Many of the people assembled in the church were shedding
tears of joy, whilst they accompanied the chants of the priests
at the altar, for they were congregated there to thank God for
the victories which had been won, as well as to witness the
rewarding of him who had fought so valiantly against the
enemies of Christ.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Burgos blessed the arms about to be presented
to the new knight.</p>

<p>Then Rodrigo Diaz and Guillen, who had both been kneeling,
arose and approached the arms, which stood before the altar.
They were imitated by the ladies and cavaliers who were
assisting at the solemn ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>The young man bent his knee, and Rodrigo said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"The order of knighthood which you are about to receive
imposes duties on you in which you must not fail. It commands
you to serve God and the king; it binds you to speak
the truth always, to be loyal to your friends; to be abstemious,
and to seek the companionship of wise men, who can teach
you to live well, and of warlike men, who can teach you to fight
bravely; it binds you to have good arms and accoutrements,
good horses in your stable, and a good sword by your side;
it commands that you shall not dare to go to the Court on a
mule, but on a horse, nor enter the palaces of the king without
a sword; it binds you not to speak flattery, nor to utter jests,
nor play any game of chance, nor eat without tablecloths; it
binds you not to complain of any wound you may receive, nor
to groan during an operation, nor to boast of any deed you may
perform; it binds you to have no contention with a young
maiden, nor engage in a lawsuit with the wife of a hidalgo;
if you should meet a brave and noble dueña in the street, it
binds you to dismount and accompany her; if a noble woman
or young woman asks a favour of you, and you do not grant it,
it ordains that ladies should call you 'a badly ordered and
discourteous knight'; it ordains that you must not be at the
Court without serving some lady, not to dishonour her, but to
make love to her, and, if you are a bachelor, to marry her, and
when she goes forth you must accompany her according as she
may desire, on foot or on horseback, with your hood removed,
and doing reverence with your knee; it binds you, finally, to
assist the weak, whatever their position may be, whenever they
ask for your help."</p>

<p>When the Cid recited to the youth these statutes, which
were, without any doubt, in force two hundred years later,
when the statutes of the "Caballeros de la Banda" were compiled,
he said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you swear to faithfully comply with all that the law of
chivalry commands?"</p>

<p>"I swear," answered Guillen.</p>

<p>"If you so act, may you be accounted a good knight, and may
God aid you in all the enterprises that you undertake; if you
should do the contrary, cavaliers and peasants will despise you
as vile and perjured, and nothing you undertake shall succeed."</p>

<p>He then gave him the kiss of peace on the mouth and the
stroke on the shoulder, bound on the sword, which had been
blessed, and which a page presented to him on a cushion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
immediately after Ximena buckled on the spur, which another
page brought forward in the same way as the sword.</p>

<p>Then the bishop, the clergy, and the people chanted the
first verse of a Psalm of David&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blessed be the Lord my God, who gave me hands to
fight, and taught me the art of war."</p>

<p>And thus terminated the solemn ceremony, the people
leaving the church and cheering the newly-made knight, who
proceeded to the residence of the Cid, accompanied by him, by
Ximena, and by the brilliant escort which had been with them
in the church of Santa Gadea.</p>

<p>The people of Burgos devoted themselves to merrymaking
during the remainder of the day, and even into the late hours
of the night, which was calm and beautiful, and lit up by a
brilliant moon. Rodrigo had divided amongst the needy a
large portion of the spoils which had fallen to his share after
the recent victories, and that liberality had increased the
public joy, already very great on account of the triumph
obtained by the Christian army over the infidels. There was
music and dancing in the public places; there were games of
various kinds; and the evening terminated with a spectacle,
as popular at that period as bull-fights were afterwards. In
one of the largest squares of the city a circus was constructed
with boards, and in it took place pig-baiting. This singular
amusement was carried out in the following manner. Some of
those animals were driven into the circus, and men then
entered it with stout sticks, having their eyes bandaged, and
with iron helmets on their heads. Whoever struck a pig with
his stick became the possessor of the animal; however, it
happened sometimes that the men cudgelled each other
terribly, although it was ordered not to strike violently, and
this constituted the principal amusement. During the evening
of which we write, there was greater noise and uproar than
usual, for the country people had indulged in large potations
of wine, in order to celebrate with greater joy the triumph of
the army of the Cid, and in dealing their blows in the circus
they paid little attention to regulations and prohibitions.</p>

<p>Country people were generally the actors in these games, but
when they were celebrated in honour of some very important
and propitious event, pages and squires also frequently took
part in them. In proof of this we mention the fact that Alvar,
the page of Rodrigo Diaz, entered the circus on the day that
Guillen was knighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>The foolish page had, during the day, raised his elbow with
marvellous frequency, and was in a humour to fight with
something or other&mdash;with pigs or rustics, if he could not find a
bull as fierce as the one he attacked when returning, a few
days before, with the army of his master to Burgos. Thus it
happened that, despite the advice of his friends, and especially
that of Fernan, who had retired to sleep off his debauch, he
insisted on having his eyes bandaged in order to sally forth to
the conquest of the pig.</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub, Alvar," said Fernan to him,
when he found that it was impossible to dissuade him from his
intention, "you are the greatest fool that eats bread in Castile.
You are as full of wine as a grape, and you imagine you will
be able to hit the pig."</p>

<p>"May I never drink another drop of it if I don't win as fine
a pig as that of St Antony!" answered Alvar, stretching out
his neck so that his eyes might be bound.</p>

<p>"The cudgellings you get from me are not enough, I
suppose, and you must needs go off to get more from the
rustics?"</p>

<p>"Your preachings are all in vain, brother," replied Alvar.
"May I be turned into a pig myself if I leave the circus
without one!"</p>

<p>Fernan did not persevere any longer with his counsels.
Alvar went into the circus, blindfolded and armed with a
stout stick, which he had to use to keep himself on his feet,
such was the state of drunkenness in which he was.</p>

<p>The pig which just then happened to be in the circus,
finding itself harassed at the opposite side, ran towards the
side where Alvar was standing, and rushed violently between
his legs.</p>

<p>The animal, finding this obstacle in its path, gave a loud
grunt; its pursuers heard it, and made their way, with raised
sticks, to the place where they thought the pig was. Alvar
was struggling to raise himself, and as the country people, on
coming up to him, heard the noise he was making on the
ground with his hands and feet, and also his puffing and
panting, they thought the pig was before them, and
brought down their cudgels with such force on the unlucky
page that, but for his cries, they would have made a speedy
end of him.</p>

<p>Fernan rushed to the circus, followed by other servitors of
the house of Vivar, raised up and carried off Alvar, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
bones were almost broken by the terrible cudgelling which he
had received&mdash;a cudgelling which, if it moved the pity of some
spectators, excited laughter and enthusiastic cheering amongst
the great bulk of them.</p>

<p>When Fernan heard this laughter and cheering, which the
misfortune of Alvar had caused, he directed his gaze threateningly
towards the crowd, and cried out, full of indignation&mdash;</p>

<p>"I vow by Judas Iscariot that I would give my soul to the
devil for a dozen men to attack with stout cudgels that crowd
of rascals, who laugh thus at other people's misfortunes, and
beat and bruise them, like pigs as they are."</p>

<p>The good squire then hastened to lead the unfortunate page
where he could be attended to; he was as afflicted at the
mishap as Alvar himself, for with regard to their relations we
may appropriately quote the Castilian proverb, "<i>Quien bien te
quiere te hará llorar.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">IN WHICH WE CONTINUE TO PROVE THAT THE CID WAS A
CID IN EVERY WAY</p></blockquote>


<p>The first care of Rodrigo Diaz, having defeated the Moors as
the result of his expedition from Portugal, was to send
messengers to the king, Don Fernando, to announce to him
that victory.</p>

<p>The king was in Coimbra when he received this auspicious
news, and he determined to return immediately to Castile, as
he wished to see his family again, and also to attend to an
important matter which was pending between him and Henry
IV., Emperor of Germany, who for a considerable time had
been demanding from him vassalage and tribute, which Don
Fernando refused, putting forward very valid reasons for
preserving the independence of his kingdoms.</p>

<p>When departing from Portugal he had received letters from
Rome which caused him deep anxiety, for Pope Alexander
II. threatened him with excommunication and a crusade, if he
did not comply with the demands of the emperor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>In whatever portion of the annals of the reign of Don
Fernando I. we read, we find incontrovertible proofs of the
piety of that great monarch: in his reign were ransomed from
the Moors the sacred bodies of St. Isidore, Archbishop of
Seville, of Saints Justa, Rufina, Victor, and many other
servants of God; in his time were erected magnificent
cathedrals and monasteries, amongst which may be mentioned
that of Sahagun; in his time ecclesiastical discipline was
admirably regulated in Castile; in his time Christian worship,
neglected till then, on account of the continual wars with the
Moors and internal dissensions, was fully re-established; and,
as a last proof of the piety of Don Fernando the Great, history
tells us that he made long and frequent retreats in the
monastery of St. John of Sahagun, joining in pious exercises
with its monks, and taking part in all the austerities and
mortifications which, at that period, accompanied monastic
life. We can judge of those which were practised by the
monks of Sahagun, when we recall to mind many anecdotes
found in history. In one of his frequent visits to that
monastery Don Fernando noticed that the monks went about
barefooted, a custom which caused many of them to contract
deadly diseases; the king felt compassion for them, and
supplied the abbot with the money necessary to procure
sandals for them. There was in the monastery a glass vessel,
which was reserved for the superior and for the king whenever
he sought hospitality in that holy house. One day, when
Don Fernando went to Sahagun, he found the community in
a state of great affliction, and when he inquired the cause of
it he was informed that the monastery had lost one of its
most precious possessions, the glass cup of the abbot, which
had been broken. The king knew that this feeling of the
monks was not unfounded, as the loss of that article, in their
extreme poverty, was difficult for them to make good, and he
ordered a golden goblet to be made, to take the place of the
glass one.</p>

<p>A council had been held at Rome, promoted by the
Emperor of Germany, at which had assisted the King of
France and other sovereigns who supported the pretensions of
the emperor, and the letters which we have mentioned were
sent to Don Fernando as a consequence of it.</p>

<p>Don Fernando was in a state of perplexity between two
courses, either to excite the enmity of the allies of Henry IV.,
especially that of the Holy See, or to submit his states to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
vassalage, hateful to a nation which had worked out its
independence with the sword, and which was therefore proud
of it and little disposed to submit to a foreign yoke. In this
difficult matter he considered that he should not come to any
conclusion guided by his own opinion alone, but that he
should consult the wisest men of Castile and Leon, particularly
the bishops, who might be considered very competent advisers
in such a matter.</p>

<p>Whilst the grandees, noblemen, and bishops were assembling
from various districts, Don Fernando was taking repose, after
his recent fatigues, in the midst of his family, which had come
to meet him in Leon. At last the time arrived for the
opening of the Cortes, and the dejection of the king was
changed into hope and gladness when he saw himself surrounded
by so many illustrious men&mdash;some famous for their
wisdom, others for their nobility. All the great men of the
kingdom were arriving in Leon, and, notwithstanding, at the
time for commencing the debates, Don Fernando did not see
at his side him whom he most desired to be present, Rodrigo
Diaz, the brave cavalier, whose advice he thought more of
than that of all the other nobles of Castile and Leon. How
was it that Rodrigo had not come to the Cortes, to assist the
king, when he was so much in need of the counsels of all
good men, and when a matter of such vital importance was
about to be considered, whether Castile and Leon should or
should not be made subject to a foreign yoke?</p>

<p>Don Fernando explained to the nobles the object for which
he had summoned them together, and the high importance,
in his opinion, of the question which they had to decide.</p>

<p>"Do you believe," he asked of them, "that Castile and
Leon should acknowledge vassalage to the Emperor of
Germany, whose pretensions are supported by the Pope, or
that we should repudiate it?"</p>

<p>"Those who were present," as Mariana relates, "were not
unanimous. They who were most religiously disposed
advised that submission should be made, in order that the
Pope might not be offended, and that disturbances might not
be stirred up in Spain, which would necessarily injure the
country very much, as in every possible way civil war should
be avoided, as the country was divided into many kingdoms,
and as so many Moors, enemies of Christianity, were in it.
Others, more daring and of greater courage, said, that if they
yielded, Spain would be submitted to a very heavy yoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
which it would never be able to shake off; that it would be
better to die with arms in their hands than to permit such
injury to their country, and such lowering of its dignity."</p>

<p>The views of those last mentioned, who consisted of
Arias Gonzalo, Peranzures, and many more, were those
which were most in harmony with the opinion of Don
Fernando; he, however, considered the opposite one worthy
of deep consideration, as it was that of the majority, and
especially that of many wise and virtuous prelates, and it was
at last virtually decided to yield to the demands of the
emperor and his allies.</p>

<p>The debates had already ceased, and those who had been
present at them were about to leave the chamber in which
the Cortes had been held, when the arrival of Rodrigo Diaz
de Vivar was announced. Prolonged expressions of satisfaction
on the one part, and of annoyance on the other, arose
on all sides, and joy shone in the countenance of the king.
The Counts of Carrion and of Cabra bit their lips with fury,
and interchanged looks, the significance of which no one
knew just then, but which the reader shall learn very soon.
The Cid appeared in the council chamber a moment after.
Notwithstanding the solemnity of the occasion, Don Fernando
arose from his throne, in order to advance to meet Rodrigo,
whom he clasped in his arms, not permitting him to prostrate
himself at his feet.</p>

<p>All fixed their looks on the Count of Carrion, and all
remarked the vexation and rage which were excited in him
by those signal proofs of friendship and affection which the
king exhibited towards De Vivar.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Don Fernando, beaming with joy, "my hope
was not vain that you would arrive before the question we
were considering was finally settled, so that we might have
the advantage of your loyal counsels. Why have you delayed
so long, when your presence was so necessary? My desire to
clasp you in my arms, long before this, was very great."</p>

<p>"Sire," answered Rodrigo, with a certain embarrassment,
which the king could not help noticing, "my family detained
me rather too long; you, who love yours so much, can easily
understand the effect of the tears of a wife, who fears, when
her husband is leaving her, that she may not see him again
for a very long time. Perhaps I have failed in my duty as a
good subject, and in the gratitude which I owe to you, but I
assure you, sire, that it was impossible for me to avoid it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"The proofs of loyalty, which you have always given,
suffice abundantly to prove it to me, Rodrigo."</p>

<p>"Sire, dispose of my life and of all that I possess, for they
are not sufficient to repay your kindness!" exclaimed Rodrigo,
deeply moved.</p>

<p>"Are you well informed, Rodrigo, as to the serious business
which has obliged me to summon together all the leading
men of my kingdoms?" asked Don Fernando.</p>

<p>"No person in Castile is ignorant of it, sire," replied the
Cid. "It is a question of the freedom or of the enslavement
of a brave and proud nation, which has won its independence
by fighting against foreign foes during four centuries. Has
not such a nation some interest in the question which brings
us together here?"</p>

<p>The presence of the Cid caused the debates, which were
thought to be ended, to commence afresh. Those who were
disposed to refuse vassalage to the emperor had now some
hopes of seeing their views prevail, as they felt sure that the
Cid would support them, and they knew that the influence of
De Vivar was very great.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Diaz listened for some time to the arguments of
the opposed parties, and then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have scarcely shaken off the yoke which the Moors
held over our humiliated heads, and shall we now allow
Christians to make us vassals and enslave us? Our ancestors
smashed to pieces the heavy yoke imposed on them by the
Romans, and shall we now permit the Germans to bend us
down under another? Theirs would then become the power,
the authority, the honour, the riches, which our fathers won
with their blood. And what would remain to us? Trials,
dangers, slavery, and poverty! It is better to die as brave
men than lose the liberty which our forefathers left us as a
sacred inheritance!"</p>

<p>Almost the entire assembly broke out into exclamations of
assent when Rodrigo had pronounced those words. A bishop,
however, whose name the "Chronicles" do not mention, arose
from his seat and replied to him thus&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the vassalage which is demanded of Castile were not
supported by the Supreme Pontiff, your reasons would be
just and valid, and it would be right to sustain the refusal
with the sword; but it is a question of obedience or non-obedience
to the Vicar of Christ."</p>

<p>"For the law of Christ Castile has fought for more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
four hundred years," replied the Cid with energy. "For the
law of Christ I have fought, and shall always fight, and
nevertheless I should consider myself a bad Christian, a bad
cavalier, and a bad Castilian, if I were not to oppose to the
utmost the demand of the emperor, even though it be
supported by the Pope. If Castile is now, when free and
rich, only barely able to keep the infidels in check, how can
she conquer them when poor and enslaved? The vassalage
which the foreigner seeks to impose on us will enervate our
strength, will pauperise us, will make us cowards as well as
slaves, and then&mdash;what will become of the faith of our
fathers, what will become of the Cross, which until recently
was under the subjection of the Crescent?"</p>

<p>Cries of enthusiasm, which even the presence of the king
and the solemnity of the occasion were not able to keep
down, answered those words of Rodrigo Diaz. Even those
who, with the greatest zeal, had maintained that the demands
of the Germans should be acceded to, changed their minds,
with the exceptions of the Counts of Carrion and Cabra and
a few others, who were envious of the favour and advancement
which the Cid enjoyed. The latter turned towards
Don Fernando, and continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sire, you were born in an evil day for Spain, if in your
time a people should become enslaved who, until now, have
been always free. If you consent to such a terrible humiliation,
all is lost&mdash;lost is all the honour which God has given
you, and all the good He has accomplished for you. Whoever
counsels you to accede to the demands of the emperor
is not loyal, nor does he love your honour or your sway&mdash;he
deserves not to be a son of our beloved Castile."</p>

<p>The Count of Carrion and his partisans placed their hands
on their swords, unable to restrain their fury; and they would
have drawn them if the voice of the king had not been heard
above the loud applause which drowned the last words of
Rodrigo. Don Fernando cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Silence, vassals, silence! Who is it that dares to lay
his hand on his sword in the presence of his lord and king?
A valiant cavalier, a noble, who is as good a Christian as
he is a good knight, is he who sustains opinions different to
yours. You all have been summoned here to speak freely
what you think, and even if I were not present, the gravity
and importance of this assembly should restrain you. Speak,
De Vivar, for we consider all advice important, whether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
be given with the energy which befits a brave soldier, as
you are, or with the calm deliberation which characterises
ecclesiastics."</p>

<p>Don Suero and his friends became quiet, much against
their wills, and the silence and order of the assembly were
restored.</p>

<p>"I do not believe," continued Rodrigo, "that the Pontiff
will close his ears to our just prayers; let us send those to
him who will defend our freedom in his presence, and explain
to him how unjust and impolitic are the pretensions of the
Germans; but if our reasonings avail nothing, we must then
have recourse to the sword. For my part, I am now resolved
to defend against the entire world the honour and the liberty
which my ancestors have handed down to me, and those who
agree in my views I look on as my friends, and as the friends
of our country. If the Germans do not recognise our rights,
we have good lances in Castile wherewith to prove to them
that we have honour and courage. Rouse up the country,
sire; get together an invincible host&mdash;you can easily do so&mdash;and
cross the Pyrenees; I shall go in the front with two
thousand of my friends, and, in addition, the troops that
my Moorish tributaries shall supply me with."</p>

<p>This advice of the Cid satisfied almost all, especially the
king, and it was arranged to reply to the Pope with all respect,
but at the same time to raise, without delay, an army of ten
thousand men, which should be ready to cross the Pyrenees,
under the command of the Cid, in case the Germans and their
allies should persist in their demands. The assembly then
broke up.</p>

<p>Whilst Rodrigo Diaz was thus opposing those who advised
the king to yield to the pretensions of Henry IV., Fernan
Cardeña, with other squires and pages, was walking about
in the large square which fronted the palace which the lords
of Gormaz had owned in the city, and which was now the
property of Rodrigo, as a result of his marriage with Ximena.</p>

<p>"It appears to me," said a squire to Fernan, "that we
could kill time a little in this square by exercising ourselves
in arms; if our masters serve Castile in the council chamber,
we can serve her here by practising how to give good blows
on the battlefields."</p>

<p>"Leave me in peace, comrades," replied Fernan, "for the
son of my mother is in more humour to go asleep and rest
himself than to exercise himself in arms."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you fatigued, then?"</p>

<p>"As much as if I had just come from a fierce battle."</p>

<p>"Your journey must have been a very hasty one?"</p>

<p>"One half of it was."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, the Campeador arrived very late."</p>

<p>"That was not his fault."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"We set out from Burgos in good time, but"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You had then some ugly adventure on the road?"</p>

<p>"It would have been so, in the case of anyone but my
master."</p>

<p>"May I turn Moor if I understand you!"</p>

<p>"Then you need not hope that the son of my mother will
explain himself more fully."</p>

<p>"Anger of God! but you have very little confidence in
your friends, Fernan."</p>

<p>"How can I have confidence in anyone at the present
time? No, only believe that people love you, and, when you
least expect it, they will get up a plot against your life; and
you would lose it, as my master should have done, if he had
not been so brave, and if he had not such good cavaliers in
his company."</p>

<p>These words excited the curiosity of his hearers.</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it," they cried out; "relate to us the
adventure that befell the Cid on his journey from Burgos
to Leon."</p>

<p>"I swear that, for a prattler, I deserve to be driven with
cudgels from his service by my master!" cried Fernan,
indignant with himself for his indiscretion.</p>

<p>"Relate it to us, comrade, for we shall know from you
exactly what took place, and not with the addition of all kinds
of embellishments, which the people will invent before long."</p>

<p>Fernan, as it concerned honourable deeds of his master,
felt that he should burst if he did not relate them; he seemed
satisfied, with regard to his conscience, by the remarks of the
last speaker, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Keep secret what I am about to tell you, for my lord,
Don Rodrigo, ordered all who were with him at the time
not to speak of it, and he must have had his reasons for
doing so, and I should respect them. You must know, then,
that we sallied forth from Burgos early yesterday, in order
to arrive here in good time. My master had no other cavaliers
with him but Martin Antolinez and Guillen of the Standard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
as he is now called, because he rescued that of Don Rodrigo;
and no other squires but the two who are now asleep in the
stable and myself; for that fool Alvar still keeps his bed,
as a result of a certain cudgelling he got Martin Vengador
has gone to Vivar to see his sweetheart, and Rui-Venablos
could not leave the band, which has entered into the service
of my master, and which he commands during the absence
of Martin, who is its captain. We were passing through a
wood near Carrion, when certain very dolorous wailings
attracted our attention; we stopped to listen, when we heard
a woman's voice, which cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Succour me, succour me, travellers! for my house is on
fire, and my children, who are in it, will be burned.'</p>

<p>"We all hastened to the place from which the voice sounded,
and, on a small hill, we saw the person who had called out;
it was a woman with dishevelled hair, and with all the signs
of great despair.</p>

<p>"'Where is your house&mdash;in which direction?' we asked,
when still at some distance from her.</p>

<p>"'You will find it just round the turn of this hill,' she
replied to our question. 'Do you not see the smoke which
is rising to the sky? Go thither, good cavaliers, and save
my unhappy children, if there is still time; but there will be,
if you hasten.' In reality, a column of smoke was rising
behind the hill.</p>

<p>"We applied spurs to our horses, and, in less time than
I tell it, we turned the small hill, and at a short distance,
beside a thick cluster of trees, we saw a house from which
cries proceeded, seemingly those of children, and from which
dense smoke was arising.</p>

<p>"On arriving at the house we all dismounted, dashed in
the door with a few good kicks, and hastily entered."</p>

<p>"And did you save the children?" asked, impatiently, those
who were listening to the narration of Fernan.</p>

<p>"The children which we found," he answered, "were ten
very big men, who were concealed in one of the rooms of
the house, and who rushed, swords in hand, on us, and
especially on my master, who was in the front. May
Beelzebub take my soul if ever I saw a fiercer fight than
that which then took place in the small room. Guilt doubtless
caused those ruffians to lose their presence of mind, for
they all missed their first strokes and gave time to Don
Rodrigo and the two other cavaliers to draw their swords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
and close with them. The fight lasted only a short time, but
it was fierce and bloody. Four of the assassins fell to the
ground, pierced by the sword of my master, and the others
jumped through a window and escaped through the wood."</p>

<p>"What a terrible picture must have presented that combat
in a house which was on fire!" exclaimed one of the squires.</p>

<p>"What was on fire was a lot of straw, heaped up in a
yard," replied Fernan; and he then continued: "Guillen
thought he recognised one of the assassins, who was weltering
in his blood, and when he examined him closely, he uttered
a cry of surprise and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Illan! you armed with an assassin's dagger! wretched,
wretched man! And it was you who expressed surprise that
I should be in the service of the Count of Carrion before
we separated at the railings of the porch of Santa Gadea.'</p>

<p>"'Pardon, pardon, Guillen!' murmured the man called
Illan. "'Avarice&mdash;the gold which Don Garcia and Don
Suero promised us, if we killed the Cid and you, blinded me.
Pardon a dying man, and do not go to Carrion, for Don Suero
knows that you love the Infanta'&mdash;</p>

<p>"'May God pardon you, as I do,' replied Guillen. And
we all left the house, in pursuit of those who had fled through
the wood. We spent many hours in search of them, in that
hilly country, and at last, despairing of finding them, we continued
our journey hither, both ourselves and our horses being
much fatigued, as we had to press onward very quickly to
make up for lost time."</p>

<p>"And who was the woman that allured you to the
ambuscade?"</p>

<p>"Some witch, doubtless, for she became invisible from
the time she spoke to us from the top of the hill, and we
could find her no more than the others we were seeking."</p>

<p>The squires had come to this part of their conversation
when, the Cortes being ended, the nobles who had taken part
in it began to issue forth from the Alcazar.</p>

<p>Fernan impressed on his friends the necessity of the
strictest secrecy with regard to that which he had related to
them, and went off to the residence of his master, whom he
saw going towards it, accompanied by Martin Antolinez and
Guillen.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">WHICH TREATS OF CAVALIERS FREE WITH THE HAND AND
PEASANTS FREE WITH THE TONGUE</p></blockquote>

<p>As had been determined at the Cortes held at Leon, the king,
Don Fernando, wrote to the allied powers refusing the tribute
which the Emperor of Austria had demanded; also giving
the reasons on which that refusal was based. Meanwhile the
Cid, by his orders, was occupied in getting together an
efficient army by means of which Castile would be able to
oppose the foreigners, if they appealed to arms to sustain their
demands, as they had threatened. Seeing that there was not
perfect agreement amongst them, and that, on the contrary, in
France and other countries allied to the Germans, warlike
preparations were being made, Don Fernando consulted the
Cid and other cavaliers as to whether he should cross the
Pyrenees or remain in Castile on the defensive. All upheld
the former proposition, for they said: "The less we embarrass
the foreigners the more time will they have to prepare their
armies for a campaign; and if they see us remain quiet in
Castile, they will look upon us as very weak, both in numbers
and in courage, as we do not dare to challenge them on their
own soil. Let us make a display of valour, and our enemies,
seeing that we are neither weak nor faint-hearted, will soon
change their opinion."</p>

<p>The Cid then demanded aid from Abengalvon and from the
other Moorish kings, his vassals, and as they not only sent it,
but also came themselves, leading the regiments which they
furnished to the Castilians, the army of Don Fernando soon
set out for the French frontiers.</p>

<p>Don Fernando commanded the main army, composed of
eight thousand men, and Rodrigo Diaz marched in advance,
in order to select good quarters.</p>

<p>When the Cid entered the gates of Aspa he found great
disturbance amongst the inhabitants of that district; so much
so that they would not furnish the Castilians with quarters nor
sell provisions to them; moreover, they endeavoured to do as
much injury to them as was in their power.</p>

<p>Rodrigo ordered that the crops and houses of the rebels
should be burned, but that, on the contrary, all those should
be well treated who provided quarters and sold food to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>On arriving near Tolosa, the Cid learned that large hostile
forces were sallying out to meet him, with the object of
preventing his advance. Don Ramon, Count of Savoy, was
approaching with twenty thousand men, and with full authority
from the King of France to engage in hostilities with the
Castilians.</p>

<p>"My army numbers two thousand men," said the Cid, "but
we must either prove to France, and to the entire world, that
two Castilian cavaliers are equal to twenty foreigners, or
else die gloriously. Our enemies have decided to attack
us before the king's army can arrive; there are but two things
left to us, either to face them as we are, or to turn back in order
to reinforce ourselves with the soldiers who are coming on
with Don Fernando. Turn back? No, no! Let us rather
advance to certain death than turn our backs to the enemy."</p>

<p>Rodrigo now made his warriors ready for the fight, as his
enemies appeared at but a short distance from them.</p>

<p>"St. James! St. James!" he then cried out, and closed
with the hostile force.</p>

<p>The combat was fierce, and lasted for an hour. In that
time prodigies of valour were performed, not alone by the
Castilians but also by the Moorish warriors who accompanied
the Cid, at whose side Abengalvon and the other Moorish
kings fought, and by Guillen of the Standard, to whom
Rodrigo had confided his own, in order to confer a fresh proof
of confidence, and to mark the esteem in which he held him.</p>

<p>The army of the Count of Savoy was cut to pieces, and Don
Ramon himself was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>This first victory of the Castilians filled the allies of the
emperor with terror; nevertheless, the King of France sent
against the invaders a fresh army which he kept in reserve in
Gascony.</p>

<p>These forces marched forth to the encounter of the representative
of Don Fernando in the same way as those of the
Count of Savoy had done, and, like those, they were routed by
the Cid and his two thousand cavaliers before the king could
arrive to take part in the combat.</p>

<p>The Count of Savoy begged for his liberty, as the fact of
his being a prisoner wounded his pride, and because disturbances
which had broken out in his own states urgently required
his presence there. Don Fernando refused his request, fearing
that his object was to organise fresh forces wherewith to
avenge the humiliating defeat which he had suffered. Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Ramon then offered, as a hostage, his daughter, whom he
dearly loved, and who was very beautiful and discreet. Don
Fernando considered this sufficient, and the count obtained
his freedom, leaving his daughter in the power of the King of
Castile.</p>

<p>The allied sovereigns sent letters to Don Fernando, praying
him not to advance farther, and offering to agree to terms for
peace; the King of Castile, as a result, established his headquarters
in Toulouse, and sent the Cid, Alvar Fañez Minaya,
Arias Gonzalo, Martin Antolinez, and other cavaliers to Rome
to inform the Pope that ambassadors should proceed to Spain
empowered to treat for peace.</p>

<p>The Pope called together a council, and in it debated as
to what steps should be taken. All were of opinion that the
demands of Don Fernando should be acceded to, for, they
said, "if we should decide to settle this contest by means of
arms, no one will dare to oppose this famous Cid, whom all
look upon as invincible." In consequence of this decision, the
king sent, as his plenipotentiary, the Cardinal of Santa Sabina;
others also were sent, with full powers, by the emperor and
the other allied sovereigns, between whom and the King of
Castile it was stipulated, in proper form, that vassalage, of any
form whatsoever, should never be demanded of Spain.</p>

<p>Six months were spent in these preliminaries and treaties,
and at the end of that period the Castilian army recrossed the
frontiers, and was received in Castile with the greatest enthusiasm,
which the people gave expression to by loud acclamations and
splendid festivities.</p>

<p>The people of Castile had loved the Cid very much, and
that love now changed almost into adoration after the recent
splendid feats of arms of the brave cavalier, and especially on
account of the valour and the energy with which he had
defended the freedom of the kingdom at the last Cortes in Leon.
Nations are extreme in their loves and hatreds. When a public
man should be exalted, they raise him to the very clouds;
when his humiliation is concerned, they drag him through the
mire; they always exaggerate things, whether it is a question
of reward or punishment. The acts of the Cid were really
splendid, but in the eyes of the populace they were very much
more.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Burgos were occupied with the feats of
Rodrigo, and they explained them and commented on them
in their own way. Many of his exploits were pure inventions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
of popular enthusiasm and credulity; this, however, only
strengthens what we have said, that the Cid was the idol of the
Castilian people.</p>

<p>Just at the entrance into Burgos, on the northern side,
resided a worthy artisan who worked constantly before the
door of his house as a farrier. Our readers already know
Iñigo, for that was his name, having seen him exchange blows
with a rustic on the day that Ximena entered the city to
celebrate her nuptials with Rodrigo Diaz. Iñigo was a type
of the populace in its most perfect form; he was talkative,
irascible, enthusiastic, credulous, fond of news, a grumbler&mdash;in
a word, all that his class has ever been. A fly scarcely
moved in Burgos but Iñigo knew where it flew to: if he had
lived in our times he could have made plenty of money as a
member of the detective police, or as a supplier of events of
the day to some newspaper. If a muleteer entered Burgos on
a very hot day, Iñigo would say to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are welcome, brother. This is a bad time for travelling.
What news on the roads? Won't you sit down for a
while on this bench, and take a draught of this deliciously
cool water which I have here?"</p>

<p>And the muleteer, believing that it would be discourteous
if he did not accept the invitation, would stop to satisfy the
curiosity of Iñigo.</p>

<p>If a peasant woman came in when the weather was cold,
with a basket of eggs or other farm produce on her head, Iñigo
would say to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are welcome, sister. This is a bad time to come to
town. Is there any news in your district? Won't you put
down your basket, and warm yourself at the good fire I have
here?"</p>

<p>And the peasant woman would do just the same as the
muleteer.</p>

<p>If there is added to the information he obtained in this way
all that he picked up from squires who brought their masters'
horses to be shod, from the women and men of the vicinity,
who rested themselves, talking meanwhile of their neighbours'
affairs, on the bench of the horse-shoer, which was pleasantly
shaded from the sun, all the world will agree that Iñigo was
exactly suited to fill a position of the nature of those which we
have mentioned above.</p>

<p>Two days after the return of the Cid to Burgos, there
entered the city the same peasant to whom Iñigo had given so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
sound a drubbing on a former occasion. The farrier and he
had become friends again, to judge by the way they saluted
each other.</p>

<p>"You are welcome, Señor Bartolo," cried out the former on
seeing the peasant.</p>

<p>"God keep you in His guard, Master Iñigo," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I was just saying to myself, that, considering all the news
that is flying about Burgos, it is curious that Señor Bartolo is
not coming to hear it."</p>

<p>"Oh, then there is a lot of news, eh? I swear that one
might just as well be a captive among the Moors as live in a
village."</p>

<p>"What, does news never get to Barbadillo?"</p>

<p>"You may say, none. I tell you we live like beasts in the
villages. Whenever I smell any news in the air, I come to the
city to see you. And as you are so wise and clever, and all
that kind of thing, you polish me up a bit. What is to be
learned in a village? That a wolf ate a sheep belonging to
Uncle Pellica; that Uncle Colambra got drunk, and gave his
wife a beating; that the daughter of Aunt Valeta fell in love
with four young fellows; and other things of a similar nature.
What wonder is it, then, that one is always bored when living
in such a place? I swear I am."</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, Señor Bartolo, great good luck to live in a
city."</p>

<p>"And what gets up my blood most is that my wife is constantly
wrangling with me because I come now and then to
the city to learn the news; she says that I am always neglecting
my land and my cattle."</p>

<p>"Your wife must certainly be a great ass, Señor Bartolo."</p>

<p>"And she is not the only one that finds fault with me; all
my neighbours are against me. I was formerly stupid and
ignorant like themselves, and they don't like to see me getting
a little knowledge into my head."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Señor Bartolo, your neighbours must be all
great blockheads."</p>

<p>"But I swear I won't stand it any longer; in spite of my
wife and neighbours, I'll get rid of the bit of ground I own, and
the cottage I have in the village, and come to live in Burgos."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Señor Bartolo, you should come to the city, for
it is a great pleasure to know at once all that is passing in the
world, and just at present there's good news coming every
day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"What good news, eh?"</p>

<p>"Good, Señor Bartolo, very good."</p>

<p>"And what is it all about, Master Iñigo?"</p>

<p>"About the Campeador, as you may well suppose."</p>

<p>"By San Pedro of Cardeña, the Cid is a splendid cavalier!
But tell me, tell me, Master Iñigo, the latest news of him."</p>

<p>"I will, Señor Bartolo. You know already what a good
beating he gave the French, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; you told me all about that already. Anger of
God! how I should like to have been on the top of the Pyrenees
to see from there how the Cid and his army treated those
French dogs."</p>

<p>"You know also that the Cid was at Rome, with other good
cavaliers?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; you told me that too."</p>

<p>"But that which you don't know is what happened there to
the Cid."</p>

<p>"What happened to him? Did he fight a terrible battle
with that Don Vaticano, as they call him?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Master Iñigo, are you also making game of me?"</p>

<p>"I was laughing at your ignorance and simplicity, for you
are mistaking the Pope's palace for a cavalier; the Vatican is
a palace, and not a man."</p>

<p>"Curses on the village! living in it has made me the ass I
am. May I become a greater Turk than Mahomet if I don't
leave it at once!"</p>

<p>"Learn, then, that the Cid, when he arrived in Rome, went
straight to the church of St. Peter"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's something like a church, I've heard, and not like the
one in my village."</p>

<p>"Yes, Señor Bartolo, they tell wonders of it; they say it is
built of blocks of diamond."</p>

<p>"San Pedro de Cardeña! what a great misfortune it is to
live in villages and not in cities, where there are such riches!"</p>

<p>"Know, then, that the Cid went to St. Peter's to see the
throne of the Pope, which is made of solid gold."</p>

<p>"Anger of God! It must be a fine thing to be a Pope."</p>

<p>"All the Christian kings have seats near the Pope's throne,
and when the Campeador saw that the seat of the King of
France was placed a little higher than that of the King of
Castile, he kicked it down."</p>

<p>"I swear that it would have been a great misfortune for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
not to know of that act, so worthy of being known. I
certainly shall leave Barbadillo."</p>

<p>"As the seat of the King of France was made of marble, it
broke into pieces. And what do you think the Cid then did,
Señor Bartolo? He took that of the King of Castile and put
it in the principal place."</p>

<p>"My God, what a good vassal! May God preserve him!"</p>

<p>"Then out spoke a duke, who is called the Savoyard, and
said to the Campeador, 'May you be accursed, Rodrigo,
and may the Pope excommunicate you, for having insulted the
King of France, the most honoured sovereign in the world.'
'Leave kings aside,' said the Campeador; 'and if you consider
yourself aggrieved, let us settle this quarrel between us.'"</p>

<p>"And the Cid and the Savoyard fought? I swear that I
am delighted with your story."</p>

<p>"As they were going out of the church, the Campeador
went up to the duke and gave him a shove."</p>

<p>"God's anger! And they came to blows, eh? What did
the Savoyard do?"</p>

<p>"He remained very quiet, and made no answer to the
Campeador."</p>

<p>"By San Pedro of Cardeña, no one dares to oppose the Cid."</p>

<p>"When the Pope heard of it, he excommunicated Don
Rodrigo."</p>

<p>"What do you tell me, Master Iñigo? The Cid excommunicated!
What a pity! for he will begin to dwindle
away, as it is said those do who are excommunicated."</p>

<p>"Such did not happen, for he knelt down with much
humility at the feet of the Pope, and said to him, 'Absolve
me, holy father, for it won't be prudent of you not to do so.'
And the Pope gave him absolution, like a merciful father as
he is, saying to him, 'I absolve you, Campeador; but you
must be more circumspect in my Court.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, accursed Barbadillo! such fine things are never heard
of there! Master Iñigo, I am just going back to dispose of
all my belongings, and you shall soon see me here again. You
won't see me making an ass of myself any longer."</p>

<p>"You are right, Señor Bartolo; but won't you tell me what
is going on in your district?"</p>

<p>"I have told you: nothing whatever, Master Iñigo."</p>

<p>The farrier was about to put fresh questions to the peasant,
when he noticed that some muleteers were approaching, who,
to judge by their appearance, had come from some very distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
locality. He hastened to meet them, saluting them in his
customary way, in order to satisfy his curiosity, at the expense
of a bench which he kept beside a good fire in winter, and of
a draught of cold water which he had ready to attract travellers
in summer.</p>

<p>A few moments having passed, the peasant and the artisan
were listening with delight to the wonderful bits of news which
the muleteers brought with them, but which need not figure in
this book, as they were only vulgar gossip.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">OF THE SORROWS WHICH THE COWARDLY DON SUERO
CAUSED HIS SISTER</p></blockquote>


<p>Just at the time that Guillen left the Castle of Carrion to proceed
to the seat of war in Portugal, Bellido Dolfos entered it.
The arrival of the traitor was announced to Don Suero, and
satisfaction shone in the eyes of the count, who hastened to
receive Bellido, for he doubted not but that he brought him
some important intelligence, having returned so soon to the
castle.</p>

<p>"What tidings do you bring me? Speak at once," he asked
of the new-comer, even without waiting for his salutation.</p>

<p>"I bring you very important news, sir count."</p>

<p>"Speak, speak!"</p>

<p>"Can any person hear us?"</p>

<p>"No one, Bellido."</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding, it is just as well to shut the door."</p>

<p>And Bellido closed the door of the apartment, and then
returned and seated himself at the side of the count.</p>

<p>"What have you to tell me of that infernal band?"</p>

<p>"I have but little to tell you of the band."</p>

<p>"Then of whom do you bring me news?"</p>

<p>"Of your sister, and of the page."</p>

<p>"They returned to the castle."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>"I do not then understand what the news can be that you
bring me of them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Calm your impatience, my lord. The attentions of that
handsome page were more than a little pleasing to the
Infanta."</p>

<p>"And to me also, Bellido; for this very day I rewarded
that loyal servant, giving him the best of my horses and arms,
in order that he might go to the seat of war. You must have
met him near the castle."</p>

<p>"Is he not in the castle now?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I certainly saw a horseman issue forth. Ah, my lord,
you have allowed to escape from your hands him who is the
most deserving of your anger."</p>

<p>"By Lucifer, explain yourself, Bellido! What would you
tell me?"</p>

<p>"I would tell you that the youth loves your sister, and that
your sister returns his love."</p>

<p>The count jumped to his feet as suddenly as if a serpent
had pierced him with its fangs. Bellido had foreseen his rage,
and, in order to lessen it, had intended to break the information
to him; he had, however, precipitated it, annoyed by the
impatience and the imperious tone of Don Suero.</p>

<p>"Bellido!" exclaimed the count, gazing fixedly at his companion,
"perchance you think that I am in such good humour
that I can tolerate jokes? Do you believe that the Count of
Carrion is so much your friend that you can amuse yourself
with him?"</p>

<p>"My lord," answered Bellido humbly, "the vexation you
feel grieves me sincerely; but I can only repeat to you that
your sister and the page are in love with each other, that they
vilely deceive you, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"This calumny will cost you your life, Bellido!"</p>

<p>"If what I tell you is not the truth I am quite willing that
you cause me to be hung on the ramparts of your castle."</p>

<p>"What proofs can you give me that you are not calumniating
one of the noblest maidens in Spain?"</p>

<p>"My word, which the loyalty and the zeal with which I have
served you, will vouch for."</p>

<p>"Hell, hell! Must I believe what you tell me? No, I
cannot believe it, Bellido; it cannot be that a miserable page
has dared to set his eyes on the Infanta of Carrion; it cannot
be that my sister has opened her ears to so low-born a
youth!"</p>

<p>"My lord, I can well understand your incredulity, but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
is nothing more certain than that which I have told you.
Silence reigned in the camp of the bandits. I know not what
made me suspect that the page was something more than a
servant in the eyes of the Infanta; I crept up to the tent in
which both of them were lodged, and, as I found that they
were awake, I applied my ear to the canvas, and surprised the
secret of their love"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And if it is a fact that the page loves my sister, why has
he voluntarily left her, in order to go to the war in Portugal?"</p>

<p>"Because he aspires to the hand of your sister, and knows
that he must be at least a knight in order to marry the Infanta
of Carrion."</p>

<p>"Oh, everything conspires against me!" exclaimed Don
Suero, falling back into the violent despair which he seemed
to have mastered for a moment. "I suffer on earth all the
tortures of hell. They deceive me, they sell me; my own
kinsfolk and strangers murder me slowly. Whom can I trust?
My life appears to be that of the wicked, which my mother
often described to me; not a moment of calm; no happiness
that merits such a name, enemies on all sides; vain projects;
desires never satisfied; sadness, sleeplessness, everlasting
despair,&mdash;such was the life my mother pictured to me, and
such is mine. Oh! am I one that is accursed? No, I am
not, I am not. If I have treated my servants and my vassals
cruelly, it is because my servants and my vassals detested me,
and would have sold me. If I have enemies and plot their
destruction, it is because I cannot gain their friendship,
because they all insult me and conspire against me. This is
to live a life of agony."</p>

<p>And the count, who had bent it down, raised his head
suddenly, and such was the appearance of his countenance,
and the glitter of his eyes, that Bellido made a movement as
if to turn away from him, believing that reason had forsaken
him.</p>

<p>"Traitor!" exclaimed Don Suero, "have you come here to
take advantage of what I say? My dagger shall teach you to
be more courteous."</p>

<p>Bellido arose from his seat, and placing his hand on the
pommel of his sword, said, endeavouring to render his words
as conciliatory as possible&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, grief is overcoming you; remember that he who
stands by your side is the only loyal friend in whom you can
trust."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>Don Suero quickly recovered his senses, which, for a
moment, had abandoned him, and said, holding out his hand
to the traitor&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Bellido, pardon my burst of passion. Yes,
yes, you are right; grief, anger, despair, put me out of my
mind. Yes, you are my sole friend, the only one who has not
betrayed me, who has not insulted me, who feels compassion
for me. But is it quite certain that this miserable page loves
my sister, and that she has degraded herself by returning his
love?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, I repeat, is more certain."</p>

<p>"And what is to be done, Bellido, what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"Kill the villain who has thus betrayed your confidence."</p>

<p>"Yes, and the Infanta also deserves to die. A hundred
lives, taken one by one, would not be sufficient to expiate
such treason. But where can I find the page? What a fool
I was to let him escape my vengeance! And I have given him
arms&mdash;perchance to use them against myself, for, I doubt it
not, that traitor will proceed to Portugal, he will fight against
the Moors, rise from his present low condition, and return,
filled with pride and audacity, to insult me, to challenge me,
and to impose shameful conditions on me."</p>

<p>"As soon as he returns from Portugal he will come to see
the Infanta, and then you will find an opportunity to punish
his treachery; but, in order that he may return to the castle,
that he may fall into your hands, he must not know that you
have discovered his insensate love; you must not let the
Infanta know that you even suspect it, for Doña Teresa would
be able to discover some means of advising him, and then the
traitor would remain unpunished."</p>

<p>"Impossible, Bellido, impossible! Can I look on my sister
without my indignation breaking out? Can I put off the
punishment, which she deserves, until the day when that
traitor may feel pleased to appear in my castle?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lord, it would be difficult for you to do so;
but you must find some pretext for your annoyance. Say to
your sister that you wish to confer her hand on&mdash;the first that
comes into your head; your sister will oppose your wishes,
and then you can give vent to your anger, the real motive of
which will not be suspected."</p>

<p>"I shall do so, Bellido, I shall do so. It was a fortunate
day on which I first made your acquaintance, for you are the
only man who gives me loyal advice, who aids me to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
against that cruel fate which baffles all my enterprises, which
upsets all my plans, which does not leave a moment of
tranquillity to my soul. Yes, yes, I intend the hand of my
sister for the son of the Count of Cabra, and my sister does
not yet know of it. The occasion for telling her has arrived."</p>

<p>"But be on your guard, I repeat; do not let her suspect
that you know of her love for the page."</p>

<p>"She shall suspect nothing, Bellido. But tell me now, in
what condition is the band?"</p>

<p>"I believe that it will totally disappear within the next few
days. Although its members are now but few, they are able
to defend themselves against the Salvadores as long as they
are all together&mdash;they can at least escape from them if they
cannot conquer them as formerly. I have, however, succeeded
in dividing them, under the pretext that such is done for their
security, availing myself of the influence which I have gained
over the Vengador and Rui-Venablos, from the time I
prophesied to them that the band would be destroyed, if they
forcibly attacked the Castle of Carrion. After to-day one
half of the bandits will be encamped at a considerable distance
from the other half, so that they could not rejoin each other
quickly, should the two encampments be attacked by the
Salvadores, to whom, before I return to the band I shall give
full information. You can easily imagine that if the bandits
were deadly hostile to you before, they have been much more
so since they suffered such a terrible reverse in your castle.
For that reason you should be delighted to get rid of them
quickly."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Bellido, certainly. I trust that, with your
assistance, I shall be able to annihilate those implacable
enemies. Continue your efforts in that direction, and count
on my liberality."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Bellido, affecting diffidence, "I venture to ask
you for some money, which I require to add to the considerable
sum, which I have already expended on the bandits in
order to win their confidence, so that I might succeed in
realising my plans."</p>

<p>With every coin which he had to give, it seemed to Don
Suero that he was parting with a piece of his heart, for avarice
was the moving cause of most of his evil actions; however, as
it was necessary to secure the aid of Bellido in his favour, he
answered, going to the strong chest, in which he had on a
former occasion showed his treasures to Bellido&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take, Bellido, the money which you require. Will twenty
gold marks be sufficient for you?"</p>

<p>"That will not be enough," replied Bellido in a humble
tone of voice.</p>

<p>"I will give you forty."</p>

<p>"I must have more," said Bellido firmly.</p>

<p>"Take sixty."</p>

<p>"I require as much as a hundred," replied Bellido
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Villain!" exclaimed Don Suero in an involuntary burst
of indignation; but a moment's reflection made him recognise
that he must be prudent with Bellido, and he added in a more
subdued and friendly voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Bellido; the annoyances to which I have been
subjected make me forget myself sometimes, and I scarcely
know what I say or do. Here are the hundred marks which
you require." And he handed them to Bellido, who took
them with a joy which he vainly tried to conceal.</p>

<p>They then arranged some matters relative to the business
which had brought them together, and Bellido quitted the
Castle of Carrion.</p>

<p>Let us see what was taking place in the chamber of Doña
Teresa whilst the scene we have described was being acted
in that of the count.</p>

<p>When Guillen left the castle, the Infanta took her place at
the window of her apartment in order to see his departure, and
her eyes, full of tears, followed him until he disappeared
behind a cluster of trees which grew at some distance from
the castle. How can we explain what the loving girl
experienced at that moment? It seemed to her as if her soul
had quitted her body in order to accompany the handsome
youth who was departing from her; who was going away,
perhaps never to return. It appeared to her that the sky was
growing dark, that the fields were losing their verdure and
beauty, that the birds had ceased their warbling, that her
chamber had suddenly become as gloomy, as dark, and as
solitary as it had appeared before she was loved by Guillen;
it seemed to her as if everything was clad in mourning, as if
everything was weeping for the absence of the handsome page.
Her eyes remained fixed for a long time on that part of the
landscape where Guillen had disappeared, trying to catch a
glimpse of him, but no, he had disappeared.</p>

<p>Reader! he who writes this book appeals again to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
recollections, to your experience, to your heart, in order that
you may understand that which his pen is not able to explain.
Have you ever seen a beloved object disappear from your
sight, when going on a long journey, as the poor Teresa saw
Guillen? Have you ever walked forth from your native place,
accompanying a beloved being, who was about to be absent
for a long period, in order to prolong for a short time the sad
leave-taking, and when that at last came, did you not ascend
an eminence to see the traveller as far as possible on his way,
and did you not follow him with your gaze until the horizon
shut him off from you; and then, when he had completely
disappeared, did not your eyes overflow with tears? If you
have experienced all that, as he has done who writes this,
you will understand the grief, the anguish, the despair with
which Teresa saw her lover disappear behind the distant
trees.</p>

<p>The sad girl turned from the window with her heart full of
sadness, and kneeling down before an image of Mary, which
she had adorned with flowers every day formerly, when she
was free and happy enough to go out to gather them in the
surrounding fields, now a long time ago, she besought the
"Mother of pure love" to protect the brave and handsome
and loving youth, who had set out to fight for her love and for
the Christian faith, and she felt her heart consoled. In former
times, when she felt her soul sad, the tender, the pure, the
sweet Teresa sought consolation from her mother; but, as she
had been taken from her, to whom could she appeal but to the
universal Mother of the afflicted! Oh, what a sweet, beautiful,
and consoling religion is that which gives us an immortal
Mother, so that we may not remain orphans when she who
bore us has departed from us!</p>

<p>Teresa felt consoled; but, her sensibilities being very
much excited, she felt the necessity of conversing with someone
whom she loved and who loved her. Who then could
that person be but her brother? She was about leaving her
chamber to go in search of him, when he appeared before her,
and the poor girl trembled when she saw him, for she remarked
on the countenance of her brother a certain expression of
anger, which she had perceived in it on other occasions.
However, Don Suero was restraining himself, and succeeded
in somewhat softening that expression; and then tranquillity
and confidence returned to the heart of the Infanta.</p>

<p>"My brother," said Teresa in a sweet and affectionate tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
"accustomed to be so much by your side, I feel lonely when I
am long without seeing you, and I was therefore going to
seek you."</p>

<p>The Infanta spoke the truth when she said this: from the
time she had returned from the bandits' camp she desired to
be near her brother, whom she really loved tenderly, for she
believed that he nourished the same feeling towards her.</p>

<p>"Hypocrite!" said Don Suero to himself, and he was on
the point of breaking the resolution he had made to conceal
his anger; but he conquered that instinctive feeling, and
answered his sister kindly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I also desire to be near you, Teresa, for you are the only
being I really love. For a long time I was unjust towards
you, but at last I recognised my error, and I wish to repair it
by bestowing on you the happiness which you deserve. My
sister, I am about to prove to you that I anxiously desire
your happiness, that I desire to see you honoured, loved,
happy. Have you ever thought on the felicity to which a
woman should aspire?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, brother."</p>

<p>"Have you never thought that the greatest happiness of
an honoured and good maiden, as you are, consists in finding
a noble and loving husband?"</p>

<p>The Infanta trembled with fright on hearing this question,
and replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, brother, my mother said that to me."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Teresa, your brother is about to bestow that
happiness on you."</p>

<p>The terror of the girl came to its height.</p>

<p>"Brother," she said, "I am still very young, allow me to
remain at your side, for that is the happiness I desire at present."</p>

<p>"Teresa, at the side of the husband whom I destine for
you, you will also have the affection of your brother. Nuño
Garciez, the son of the Count of Cabra, is noble, is brave,
and loves you now for a long time."</p>

<p>"Nuño Garciez, the son of the Count of Cabra?" exclaimed
Teresa, terrified.</p>

<p>"Yes, he shall be the husband who will work out your
happiness, my sister."</p>

<p>"Impossible, brother, impossible!"</p>

<p>Anger inflamed the visage of Don Suero.</p>

<p>"Teresa!" he exclaimed, with severity, "do you mean to
say that you refuse the hand of Nuño?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Teresa could not lie; her sincerity conquered her natural
timidity.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, brother," she answered, "but I shall never
bestow my hand on the son of the Count of Cabra."</p>

<p>"May the anger of God strike you! What is that you dare
to say, traitress? Do you repay my affection by opposing
yourself insolently and rebelliously to my will? Teresa, you
shall be the wife of Nuño Garciez!"</p>

<p>"Have compassion on me, my brother; do not condemn
to eternal sadness, to eternal pain, to eternal despair this
heart which has suffered so much."</p>

<p>And the Infanta sank down on her knees before her brother,
bursting into tears.</p>

<p>"Have you any for me, perchance?" retorted Don Suero.
"Have you compassion for me when, seeing me surrounded
by enemies, you refuse to procure for me the aid of a family
which could help me to triumph over all my rivals?"</p>

<p>"But I could never love Nuño Garciez, and my vow before
the altar would be horrible perjury. Brother, have pity on
me; remember the promise you made to our mother;
remember that she, who gave you life, blessed you when she
was breathing her last; for you had just promised her that
you would be my shield, my protector, my brother&mdash;not my
executioner"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hell, hell! Arise from your knees, traitress, for your
supplications and tears are unavailing!" roared Don Suero,
at the very height of his rage.</p>

<p>And with a violent push he threw the gentle girl on the
floor.</p>

<p>Teresa arose quickly, no longer humble and timid, but
haughty as a queen whom a ruffian has insulted, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Don Suero, for you do not deserve that my
lips should give you the dear name of brother; perhaps you
may be able to escape the justice of men; perhaps God will
permit you to escape even His justice for some time; perhaps
you will torture me as long as I live; but the Infanta of
Carrion will never bestow her hand on the son of the Count
of Cabra, nor on anyone whom her heart has not chosen.
A woman may be dragged to the steps of the altar, may be
calumniated, may be barbarously ill-treated; but if she has
courage enough to die without opening her lips, as I have,
that vow cannot be dragged from her&mdash;that vow which alone
constitutes the union of husband and wife."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Silence, silence!" cried Don Suero, clutching at the
handle of his dagger, "or you will force me, at this very
moment, to punish your rebellion."</p>

<p>"I have told you already that you may kill me, for death
does not terrify me; but my hand shall never belong to anyone
who is not master of my heart."</p>

<p>"Then you shall suffer on earth all the tortures of hell;
you shall be scoffed at by even the worst ruffians; ignominy
and shame shall follow you everywhere."</p>

<p>"Shame shall never humiliate my brow, for in my life there
never has been, nor shall there ever be, anything of which I
can feel ashamed."</p>

<p>"Do you dare to speak thus, traitress? Bow your haughty
brow to the ground, for the noble Infanta of Carrion cannot
raise it proudly when she has become a renegade to her
glorious race by loving one who is base-born, one of her
wretched menials."</p>

<p>Don Suero repented, perhaps, of that burst of anger which
had caused him to reveal to his sister what he had intended to
conceal. Teresa trembled when she heard those words,
which showed that her brother was aware of her love for
Guillen; but both of them now felt that dissimulation was
useless, and the masks having been torn off, they made up
their minds to fight face to face.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the Infanta, "I do confess my love for
the menial whom you allude to; but I feel no shame on that
account, for that menial, that peasant, has a heart as noble as
that of the proudest hidalgo of Castile. I shall never feel
shame for having loved him."</p>

<p>"That traitor shall die; he shall die, hung up on the
ramparts of my castle, and his crime shall be everywhere
published; it shall be known that he was the accepted lover
of the Infanta of Carrion, and that noble Infanta will be
scoffed at by all, and the Leonese and Castilian nobles will
spit on her face."</p>

<p>"Be it so, Don Suero; the Infanta of Carrion is resolved
to encounter the ignominy with which you threaten her,
without ceasing to love Guillen, the miserable page, the
humble peasant, whom she does love with all her heart."</p>

<p>"Hell, hell!" cried Don Suero, furious, mad with anger,
and he pulled out his dagger to strike down his sister with it;
but whether it was that he was not quite cruel enough to
commit so horrible a crime, or that he wished to reserve his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
victim for greater tortures, for a more tedious agony, for a
more painful death, he returned the weapon to its sheath, and
in order not to fall again into that barbarous temptation, he
left the chamber of Teresa, speaking to himself in a loud
voice, like a madman, whilst traversing the corridors that lay
between his apartments and those of his sister.</p>

<p>When he had become somewhat calm, he took a sheet of
parchment, wrote some lines, fastened it up, called Gonzalo,
and said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Start for Burgos at once, and deliver this letter to the
Count of Cabra; gallop, do not spare the best horse in my
stables. It is now midday; if you are not back by midnight
you shall be hung on the ramparts."</p>

<p>"But, my lord," the servant ventured to say, "that time
is necessary for the journey thither alone; it is a twelve-hours'
journey from Carrion to Burgos."</p>

<p>"Villain! do you dare to disobey your master?" exclaimed
the Count, and laying his hand on his dagger he rose from
his seat.</p>

<p>Gonzalo retreated a few paces, terrified, and cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon, my lord, pardon; I shall obey your orders; I
shall be back from Burgos even sooner than you say, if such
is your desire."</p>

<p>And the servant started from the castle a few minutes
afterwards, spurring to a full gallop the very best horse that
was to be found in the stables.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">THE KING IS DEAD&mdash;LONG LIVE THE KING</p></blockquote>


<p>Some time has passed since the events which we have narrated
in the preceding chapters. Fresh victories gained over the
Moors, in the eastern portion of Castile, have raised more
and more the glory of Don Fernando, of the Cid, and of the
cavaliers who accompanied the latter.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, both Castilians and Leonese were
shocked by rumours which suddenly flew about in all
directions: Don Fernando, the great, the noble the brave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the prudent and wise, was about to exchange his crown for a
far richer one&mdash;one far more brilliant and lasting, for that
which God places on the heads of the just in heaven. Years,
together with the constant fatigues endured in the defence of
the Christian faith and in the government of the nation which
the King of kings had placed in his charge, had broken
down his health, had weakened his energies, and had brought
him to the gates of eternity.</p>

<p>He was in Cabezon, near Valladolid, occupied with the
government of his kingdom, when he found that his health
was rapidly failing, and he ordered that he should be
brought to his Alcazar in Leon, to the bosom of his family,
near to the holy temples erected by his never-to-be-forgotten
religious fervour. "They carried him," writes Mariana, "in
a military litter, borne by hand; the soldiers and exalted
private persons were constantly changed, by his orders, on
account of the rivalry which was displayed in the work;
such was the love that both humble and great felt for
him."</p>

<p>As soon as he arrived in Leon, although his disease had
become much aggravated, he got himself carried to the
churches, and visited the bodies of the saints, where he
prostrated himself on the ground, with all the marks of
the most ardent and fervent piety. This holy task completed,
he was borne to his Alcazar, where he made his
will, dividing his estates amongst his children in the following
manner:&mdash;"To Don Sancho, the eldest," writes the
above-mentioned historian, "he bequeathed the kingdom
of Castile, as it extends from the river Ebro to the river
Pisuerga; all that he inherited of Navarre, by the death of
Don Garcia, he added to Castile. The kingdom of Leon
he left to Don Alfonso, with the district of Campos, and the
portion of the Asturias which extends as far as the river
Deva, which flows by Oviedo, together with some towns of
Galicia which belonged to him. To Don Garcia, the youngest,
he gave the remainder of the kingdom of Galicia, and the
portion of the kingdom of Portugal which he had taken
from the Moors. All three were to be called kings. To
Doña Urraca he bequeathed the city of Zamora; to Doña
Elvira the city of Toro. These cities were called the
'Infantado,' a word used at that period to signify the
estates left to maintain the Infantes, the younger children
of the kings."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>Many grandees of the kingdom were gathered round Don
Fernando at that time, amongst whom were Arias Gonzalo,
Peranzures, Alvar Minaya, Martin Antolinez, Diego Ordoño
de Lara, and Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, and they all urged him
not to divide the realm into so many portions, for it was
to be feared that his doing so would give rise to sanguinary
wars.</p>

<p>"Sire," said to him the honoured Arias Gonzalo, "remember
the dissensions and the hostilities which were caused by the
division which your father, the King of Navarre, made of
his kingdom. Leave behind you one compact and strong
realm, and not several poor and disunited states."</p>

<p>Don Fernando gazed round his bed, and saw there, weeping
disconsolately, all his children.</p>

<p>"Arias," he answered to the loyal old man, "all those
whom you see weeping are my children, all have an equal
claim on my affection, and I love them all equally. Why
do you desire that I should favour one to the detriment of
the others? When I captured a fortress from the Moors,
when I conquered them on the field of battle, do you know
what was the first thought that entered my mind? I considered
that I possessed one jewel the more to leave to my
children, and then I saw no difference between them, as I
thought on all of them; for, I repeat it, my good Arias, all
my sons have an equal right to my love. I now do what
both my conscience and my heart prompt, and I trust that
my sons shall always live in concord, shall always love each
other as they have hitherto done, and shall always be
brothers."</p>

<p>Arias Gonzalo inclined his noble and rugged brow, as a
mark of respect to the will of his dying king.</p>

<p>His malady became rapidly worse; nevertheless, on the
following day, which was the second one before Christmas,
he caused himself to be carried to the church of St. Isidore,
where he heard mass with great devotion, and received
communion.</p>

<p>On the day before Christmas he returned to the same
church, clad in the robes and insignia of state, and, having
been placed near the sepulchre of the holy Archbishop, he
exclaimed in a loud voice, directing his gaze towards the
altar&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lord! Thine is the power, Thine it is to command, all
are subject to Thee, kings are Thy servants. I return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
Thee the kingdom which I received from Thy hand, and I
ask from Thee that my soul may enjoy Thy eternal glory."</p>

<p>Having said this, he laid aside his crown and mantle,
received Extreme Unction from the hands of one of the
many prelates who were present, caused himself to be clothed
with haircloth, and got his head covered with ashes, in which
condition he left the church.</p>

<p>On the next day, towards evening, feeling that his life was
touching on its close, he summoned his sons and daughters,
and also his queen, Arias Gonzalo, Rodrigo Diaz, and some
other persons.</p>

<p>"You, my good Sancha," he said to the queen, "have
always loved me, as the best of wives. In the name of the
love which you have felt for me, in the name of God, and
in the name of the people whose happiness you have always
had so much at heart, I charge you to take good care of
our children, to guide them along the paths of virtue; I know
the power which a mother, so good as you are, exercises over
her children, and in order that I may quit this world with a
peaceful soul, it will suffice that you make me the promise
which I ask from you."</p>

<p>"I swear to you, my dear husband, that I will fulfil your
wishes; I swear it to you by the salvation of my soul,"
answered Doña Sancha, bursting into tears, and kneeling
down beside the bed of the dying king.</p>

<p>He ordered his children to come near him.</p>

<p>"My children," he said to them, "the words with which
Christ inculcated love to mankind contain the chief counsels
which I desire to give you, 'Love each other.' Obey your
mother in everything, so that, guided by her advice, you may
never stray from the path of duty. You, my good Urraca,
are about to take up your residence in the city of Zamora,
you will have near you Arias Gonzalo, who has his house
there, and who will return to it as soon as, by my death, he
shall be freed from the duties which he at present discharges
in my Alcazar; consult him, ask his advice in all difficult
affairs, and trust in him, for he is honourable and wise, and
will be as a father to you."</p>

<p>"I shall never forget your counsels, my father," replied
the Infanta.</p>

<p>"Nor I, sire," said Arias; "I shall serve your daughter
with the same loyalty and goodwill with which I always
served you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sancho," then continued Don Fernando, "you already
know the love which I have always had for the Cid, and the
services which he has rendered to faith and country, as an
honourable and brave cavalier. It is fortunate for you that
you will have him by your side. Love him as I have loved him,
honour him as I have honoured him, ask his advice before
you come to any resolution, and what he counsels do always."</p>

<p>"Father," replied Don Sancho, "you know the esteem
in which I have always held the Cid; I swear to you that
he shall have the same exalted place in my heart which he
has had in yours."</p>

<p>Don Fernando recommended to Don Garcia the friendship
of a Galician cavalier, named Rui-Ximenes, and to Elvira
that of another, whose ancestral residence was in Toro, but
whose name the "Chronicles" do not mention; he then added,
turning towards his children&mdash;</p>

<p>"Swear to me, my children, that, content with the possessions
which I have given to each of you, no one of you will
ever declare war against the other, to take from him any of
those states which your dying father has bequeathed."</p>

<p>"We swear it, father and king!" answered all, except Don
Sancho, who remained silent.</p>

<p>Don Fernando noted this, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"May the malediction of heaven fall on the Cain who
will take up arms against his brother!"</p>

<p>He then ordered the Cid to approach his bed, and said
to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rodrigo, swear to me that you will never draw your
sword against a son or daughter of mine, unless you see
that such is necessary in order to protect one of them from
the oppression of another, and that your strong arm must
be used for that purpose."</p>

<p>"Sire, I swear it to you!" replied the Cid, with deep
emotion, for his heart was pierced with grief when he saw
that his king was near his last breath; he who had been so
dear a friend to him, the old man whom he had loved so
much, whom he had served so well, and from whom he had
received so many proofs of affection.</p>

<p>"Breath is failing my breast!" said Don Fernando in a
very weak voice.</p>

<p>Then his queen, his children, all present, indeed, knelt
around the bed, exclaiming with sobs&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give us your benediction, sire, give us your benediction!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>The dying king blessed all of them; but when he heard
their weeping, he made a strong effort to restore to his voice
something of the energy which was rapidly departing from it,
and said to them&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not weep for me, my wife, my children, my cavaliers,
my good servants! No pain afflicts my body or my soul;
my spirit is sweetly exhaling itself away like the perfume of
the flowers on a beautiful May morning; it is not by physical
suffering that my vital forces are weakened, but what is formed
from nothingness naturally returns to its origin. I trust in
the divine mercy, I trust in God that He will blot out my
sins from His recording book, and I go tranquil and even
joyous to the gates of eternity. If worldly things can be of
any importance to those who are about to leave them for
ever, should I not be content to see grouped around my bed
those whom I have most loved in the world?"</p>

<p>The king was then silent for some moments, remaining
as if in a calm sleep. Then his face became animated, a
smile appeared on his lips&mdash;a sweet, peaceful smile, like that
of a child that, in its sleep, sees itself surrounded by angels.</p>

<p>"What sweet music!" he murmured; "what harmonious
singing comes to my ears! What brilliancy surrounds me!
What beautiful children, maidens, and youths surround me, all
clad in white garments! What a bright throne do I see there&mdash;there!...
They lead me to it. No, no, it is not the throne
of Castile&mdash;it is more beautiful, more rich.... But&mdash;what
perfumes do I inhale!&mdash;what delights!&mdash;they intoxicate me!"</p>

<p>And the voice of the monarch ceased&mdash;ceased for ever.</p>

<p>And many of those who were in the chamber exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Blessed are the just who die thus! Blessed are those
who die in the Lord!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The children of the dead king, Don Fernando, when they
took possession of the states which their father bequeathed
to them, dedicated themselves peacefully to the government
of them, without ceasing to yield obedience to their mother,
Doña Sancha, as their father had commanded them, in which
task the Cid aided Don Sancho very much, who loved and
respected that brave and loyal cavalier.</p>

<p>"The crown became Don Sancho well," writes an historian,
"for he was of good presence, and a goodly man; of great
prowess, more skilled in the affairs of war than in those of
peace. On that account he was called Don Sancho the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Strong. Pelagio Ovetense says that he was very handsome,
and very skilful in war. He was well-conditioned, quiet and
tractable, if not irritated by some annoying matter, or if false
friends, under the pretence of doing him a service, did not
deceive him. After the death of his father he complained
that, by the division of the kingdom, an injustice had been
done to him; that the entire kingdom should have been his,
and that it had been weakened by its division into so many
parts; he talked over this in private with his friends, and
showed it even on his countenance. His mother, as long
as she lived, restrained him by her authority, and prevented
him from declaring war against his brothers."</p>

<p>Some Moorish kings in Aragon, who had paid tribute to
his father, refused to recognise vassalage to him, and he
prepared to compel them by force of arms. He collected
together an army for that purpose, and, accompanied by the
Cid, set out for Aragon. The Moors were routed in several
pitched battles; he captured many fortified places from them,
and consequently forced them to continue to pay tribute to
Castile. He had now only to conquer Almugdadir, King
of Saragosa, who, but a short time before, had succeeded
Ali, one of the five who had been captured by the Cid in
the battle of the Oca Mountains. He encamped before that
city, which was of much importance in various ways, encircling
it and attacking it with vigour; it was defended by strong
walls and a numerous garrison, accustomed to war, and the
Castilians were repulsed in several assaults; in the end, however,
Almugdadir made terms and yielded, it being agreed
that he should break off his alliance with Don Ramiro, King
of Aragon, and pay tribute to Don Sancho; the latter binding
himself, on his part, to defend him against any power which
might wage war on him, whether Christian or Moslem.</p>

<p>Don Sancho was much enraged against Don Ramiro for
having aided the people of Navarre, his enemies, who very
often made raids and irruptions into the territories of Castile,
committing all kinds of depredations; and Don Ramiro, on
his side, was very angry with Don Sancho, for he considered
that he had humiliated him by having conquered Saragosa,
which had been under obedience to him; and the conquest
of which, he believed, only appertained to him.</p>

<p>The Aragonese were stationed at the Castle of Grados
erected by the Moors on the bank of the river Esera, that it
might serve as a defence against the invasions of the Christians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
and, quitting their fortified position, they sallied forth to
encounter Don Sancho, in order to demand satisfaction from
him for the affront which they considered they had received.</p>

<p>Don Sancho asked the advice of the Cid, before replying
to the demands of Don Ramiro.</p>

<p>"Sire," answered Rodrigo, "I do not believe that the
King of Aragon denies entirely your right to compel to
obedience those infidels, who acknowledged vassalage to
Castile during the lifetime of your father, or that Don Ramiro
denies that the Christian kings of Spain should not have equal
right to seize on the territories occupied by the infidels. Explain
to him with courtesy, but without in any way lowering
your dignity, the reasons on account of which you considered
yourself justified in attacking the Moors of Aragon, and if,
not satisfied with these reasons, he should take up arms,
let you do the same; sustain the general opinion, that Castile
should never let itself be made a vassal by either Moors or
Christians. It is certainly a painful thing to have to fight
against Christians, but it is not less so that Christians should
seek to reduce to vassalage Castile, which for centuries has
fought against the Crescent. Remember what your father
did when the Germans, who were also Christians, sought to
impose vassalage on him. If at the beginning of your reign
you do not gain the reputation of firmness and bravery, even
though you may have to fight against Christians, you will be
considered pusillanimous, and even the weakest will dare
to oppose you."</p>

<p>This advice of Don Rodrigo was very pleasing to Don
Sancho, for both their views on this subject were identical,
and the King of Castile answered, in a courteous but dignified
manner, the King of Aragon; Don Ramiro, however, who
did not want explanations, but rather some pretext to avenge
his resentment, would not listen to those of Don Sancho,
but at once prepared his army for battle. Don Sancho did
the same, and the fight commenced with a fury not often seen.</p>

<p>Don Sancho and the Cid, accompanied by Diego Ordoñez
de Lara, a cavalier much devoted to the king and to Rodrigo,
and by other good knights, amongst whom were Guillen of
the Standard, Alvar Fañez Minaya, and Martin Antolinez,
were the first that closed with the army of Aragon.</p>

<p>The battle lasted for many hours, and much blood was
shed on both sides, but in the end Don Ramiro had to
abandon the field in very great disorder. Don Sancho, satis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>fied
with having taught such a lesson to the Aragonese, ceased
the pursuit, for to follow up his victory would only cause the
shedding of more Christian blood.</p>

<p>The Moors, however, who garrisoned the Castle of Grados,
when they learned that the army had retreated, filled with
dismay and with its forces much weakened, sallied forth
against it and annihilated it; Don Ramiro having been killed
in this battle before Don Sancho could come to his assistance,
for as soon as he learned that he, whom he had just
defeated as his principal enemy, was in great danger, he
advanced to the place, rather distant, where the Aragonese
and Moors were fighting.</p>

<p>The latter turned back to shut themselves up again in
Grados, being much in dread of the Castilians; and, as that
fortress was impregnable, and as Don Sancho had not been
offended directly by those who garrisoned it, the Castilians did
not consider it prudent to remain longer in Aragon, and therefore
returned to Castile, satisfied with the success which they
had achieved.</p>

<p>The people of Castile, who still deplored the loss of Don
Fernando, changed their mourning into gladness on account
of those glorious triumphs; hoping to find in Don Sancho a
king as brave, as wise, and as great as he was whom they had
recently lost.</p>

<p>Don Sancho, desirous of celebrating the propitious commencement
of his reign, and wishing to return the proofs of
affection which his people had given to him, conceded to them
many privileges and favours, and showed himself specially generous
to those who had accompanied him during his campaign
in Aragon. This increased the public rejoicings very much.</p>

<p>Guillen of the Standard did not receive the least share of his
princely munificence. Don Sancho had seen him fighting
bravely in all the battles, and, as he desired to reward his
valour, and knew that the brave youth was ambitious of
honours, he gave him such titles of nobility that Guillen could
envy few nobles by privilege, a name which was given to those
who were ennobled, not by blood, but through the privileges
received from the king as recompenses for personal actions.</p>

<p>All the Castilians, however, did not share in the munificence
of Don Sancho. He bore in mind the nobles who, having it
in their power to accompany him in the campaign, did not do
so, and he took care to manifest his vexation towards them by
leaving them unrewarded.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW CERTAIN CAVALIERS WENT FOR WOOL AND CAME
BACK SHORN</p></blockquote>


<p>Seldom was seen such activity and life in the Castle of
Carrion, in which, usually, solitude reigned: many cavaliers
were arriving at the gates of that gloomy edifice, which, during
the greater part of the year, seemed to be uninhabited, as its
owner, enclosed almost always within those dark walls, lived
apparently without any communication with the outside
world.</p>

<p>What event can explain such an assemblage of strangers in
the Castle of Carrion? Amongst those cavaliers might be
seen the Count of Cabra and other nobles, as well known as
Don Garcia for their ungovernable, intriguing, and envious
characters.</p>

<p>Let us see what they were occupied with.</p>

<p>In a large apartment of the castle about a dozen cavaliers
were assembled, whilst their servitors were talking of love and
war in the adjoining rooms, under the eye of Bellido Dolfos,
who was moving about amongst them, apparently indifferent
to their talk.</p>

<p>Let us listen to Don Suero, who took the initiative in the
debates of that assembly.</p>

<p>"The Count of Cabra and I," he said, "have come to the
conclusion that the Castilian and Leonese nobility, which has
always occupied an honoured position by the side of kings,
commenced to see itself lowered and humiliated in the time of
Don Fernando I., on account of the favour enjoyed by De
Vivar, that ambitious soldier who has succeeded in making
himself absolute master of the will of the monarch, so that he
will only hearken to his counsels. It was to be hoped that
Don Sancho II. would atone for the shortcomings of his father,
by letting himself be guided by the advice of his nobles, and not
exclusively by that of this soldier of fortune, whom, as he would
not quit his side, he should only consult in matters of war&mdash;for
instance, whether it were better to take a fortress by escalade
or by bursting in its gates with the battering-ram. But has the
new king done this? No; far from it, he consults the Cid
in all affairs of state, and follows his counsels blindly, without
admitting to his presence the nobles of the kingdom&mdash;such is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the contempt with which he treats us, and the distance at
which he holds us."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" exclaimed all his hearers; "we must assert
our dignity by putting an end to the influence and the exclusive
favour which De Vivar enjoys with the king, before the evil
progresses so far that its cure would be impossible."</p>

<p>"Remember," said the Count of Cabra, "what the king did
when he was setting out for the campaign in Aragon: he consulted
the Cid as to the prudence of undertaking that
enterprise, and he undertook it because that was the will of
De Vivar, who, in addition to being ambitious, always seeks
for opportunities to increase his wealth by the spoils of war.
It was a very ancient custom in Castile to assemble a Cortes
before undertaking enterprises of such importance as that of
leading an army against another state, and subduing it by fire
and sword; but Don Sancho considers the caprice of an
individual superior to all old customs, to expedience, and to
what he owes to the nobility of his kingdom. If, perchance,
he forgets that there are other nobles in Castile besides the
friends of De Vivar, let us bring it to his mind, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"And if he pays no attention to the arguments by which we
back up our demands," added one of the nobles, "we intend
to compel him by means of our men-at-arms; for, if the vassal
owes obedience to the king, vassals, on their side, when they
are as noble as we are, have the right to demand that the
king should respect their honour and the privileges which they,
or their ancestors, won by the sword."</p>

<p>"I can count on a hundred lances to help to humble the
arrogance of De Vivar," said one of the counts there assembled.</p>

<p>"And I the same number."</p>

<p>"And I two hundred."</p>

<p>"I with three hundred."</p>

<p>"Five hundred stand at my disposal."</p>

<p>And in succession were mentioned all the men-at-arms who
could be counted on to dictate terms to Don Sancho, in case
he should refuse their demands; the Count of Cabra, however,
who, it must be acknowledged, possessed much foresight
and skill in hatching conspiracies, objected.</p>

<p>"It is a great and important thing to trust to arms when
reasoning fails; but we must remember that the campaign of
Aragon has given to Don Sancho and to the Cid great prestige
and fame amongst the people; also, that De Vivar has very
many friends, and that he is daring, skilful, and strong in battle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
Let us respectfully protest against the excessive favour shown
to De Vivar, and if Don Sancho pays no attention to us, let us
conceal our displeasure, let us win friends, and let us dispose
the people in our favour by letting them see, by skilful management,
how undeserved is the incense which they burn before
their idol, and when we are in a position to feel sure of success,
we shall express our indignation publicly."</p>

<p>All present expressed their approval of the plan of Don
Garcia.</p>

<p>"You know already," he continued, "that Don Ramiro
owed the destruction of his army and his death to the
Castilians, to the injustice of Don Sancho, or rather to the
disloyal counsels which the Cid gave to the King of Castile.
Well, then, this fact can aid us in carrying out our plans. Don
Sancho Ramirez, the new King of Aragon, will aid us, should
we require his help, for he is panting to avenge the death of
his father."</p>

<p>The views of the Count of Cabra received the full approbation
of all present, and filled Don Suero with joy, for he
considered himself, even already, freed from De Vivar, who
was his everlasting nightmare; and having arranged as to the
manner in which they should make their protest to the king
against the excessive privileges enjoyed by Rodrigo, and having
sworn to go on with their enterprise, the meeting broke up,
the conspirators setting out for Burgos, where Don Sancho
held his Court.</p>

<p>Don Suero went as far as the gate of his castle to see them
off, where he held out his hand to Don Garcia, with all the
marks of friendship and gratitude.</p>

<p>"Don Suero," said the Count of Cabra to him, "you do
not give me a favourable message to bear back to my son."</p>

<p>"Tell him," answered De Carrion, "that he may trust in
my promise to reward the services of the father by giving to
the son the hand of my sister."</p>

<p>"Have you already arranged with the Infanta?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Don Garcia; Doña Teresa now knows who the
husband is whom I destine for her."</p>

<p>"And she accepts?"</p>

<p>"She is delighted."</p>

<p>"Oh, then I have good news to bring to Don Nuño. When
I return to see you I shall bring my son with me, for, as he has
loved your sister for a long time, it will afford him the greatest
pleasure to see her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>"My sister," replied Don Suero, somewhat disturbed, "is so
timid and bashful that, although she longs to see the young
man whom she is to marry, she will avoid his presence until
the day when she can give him the name of husband. Don
Nuño, as yourself, can honour my house when it pleases him;
but tell him, that if my sister should not venture to let herself
be seen by him, he must not be offended by that."</p>

<p>"Then, Don Suero, I believe that the day is not far distant
when your family and mine shall become relations, and we
shall defer until then the first interview between your sister
and my son."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Don Garcia, for your desire to please both my
sister and me."</p>

<p>"Trust in my friendship, and do not doubt, but that with
the aid of the cavaliers who accompanied me here, we shall
triumph over De Vivar, over that arrogant soldier, from whom
you have received so many insults. If fate was against us in
the ambush which we prepared for De Vivar when he was
going to the Cortes at Leon, and if the Moors, his allies, did
not wish to second our plans when they went to his assistance
against the allies of the Emperor of Germany, it was because
we were fighting alone; but it will be a different thing now, as
we can count on powerful auxiliaries, and have arranged a
good plan of operations. But you have told me nothing of
that treacherous page who dared to set his eyes on your
sister."</p>

<p>"That disloyal fellow is so beneath contempt that I would
only lower myself by speaking of him."</p>

<p>"And I believe that it would be an insult to your sister
were I to ask if you have remarked whether Doña Teresa
returns his mad love."</p>

<p>"As to that, Don Garcia, have no uneasiness: my sister was
filled with indignation when she learned that the youth had
dared to set eyes on her. That traitor forgot for a moment
his low condition, and believed that it was allowable to fall in
love with his mistress; but she would have got him driven
from the castle with cudgels, if she had known to what an
extent his audacity went. If we find an opportunity to
chastise him as much as he deserves, we shall take advantage
of it; if not, let us simply despise him as a madman. What
can prevent a rustic from secretly loving, I will not say the
Infanta of Carrion, but even Doña Urraca, the Infanta of
Zamora?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know of the favours which the Cid has lavished
on him?"</p>

<p>"That, Don Garcia, is another reason that both you and I
should hate De Vivar."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, Don Suero. We shall both be avenged;
have no doubt of that."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, the Count of Cabra hastened to mount his
steed, and galloped off to overtake his friends, who had already
ridden some distance.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards the king, Don Sancho, was conversing
with his mother in the Alcazar of Burgos, when Doña Sancha
said to her son&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the will of your father, if the wishes of a dying man do
not suffice to make you content with the kingdom of Castile
as your inheritance, the tears of your mother should be
sufficient to do so&mdash;she who would give a hundred lives to
prevent her children fighting against each other."</p>

<p>"Mother," replied Don Sancho, "I swear to you, that if
my brothers do not provoke a war, I shall not do so,&mdash;but
allow me the right to complain here, where none but you hears
me, of the injustice which was done me by dividing the
kingdom into five parts and giving me one of them, when
I should have received all. The kingdom of Castile and
Leon, in its entirety, should have gone to the eldest son of
Don Fernando I."</p>

<p>"Reason and justice are superior to custom, my son. Why
should a father disinherit one son because he happened to
come into the world a short time after another? In order
that a king may be good, he must be just; he must be guided
by reason; for these causes your father gained the name of
Great, and only thus shall you also merit it. His brother
challenged your father to battle, but your father refused to
accept that challenge until his kingdom of Castile was invaded.
Don Garcia having been conquered and slain, your father had
the right to take possession of Navarre, and he did so. If you
desire to imitate your father, how far should you be from
declaring war against your brothers, who do not provoke you
to do so."</p>

<p>"I shall not do it, mother, I repeat to you, even though I
consider myself very much aggrieved."</p>

<p>"Castile is a kingdom which the most powerful monarchs
envy, its people are as loyal as they are brave and warlike;
the Castilians love you, and a courageous soul beats in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
breast. Leave your brothers and sisters in peaceful possession
of their states, and enlarge your own by conquering, with the
sword, and by the aid of the good cavaliers who surround you,
infidel territories, with the possession of which Castile will
become so great and redoubtable that powerful rulers will
come to offer vassalage to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I shall do so, mother; I shall thus satisfy that
ambition which, in spite of myself, continually disquiets me."</p>

<p>"My son, you do not know how that ambition weighs upon
the heart of your mother."</p>

<p>"And do you not know why I am ambitious? Do you not
know, mother? It is because I cannot live in a close circle
without feeling that I am being smothered; it is because small
and petty things are repugnant to my soul; it is because my
spirit is only contented with the grand and the magnificent.
The title of king is but a mockery when he who bears it only
rules over a small state which can be ridden through in a few
days."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my son, if mean things are hateful to you,
respect the will of your father, and love your brothers, for it
would be paltry not to do so."</p>

<p>"My father impressed on me that I should always let myself
be guided by your counsels and by those of Rodrigo Diaz; I
shall obey him, mother."</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, let not De Vivar quit your side, give heed to
his counsels, for none can give them to you as loyally and as
wisely as that good cavalier."</p>

<p>"Oh, my mother, you cannot know how much the friendship,
which I always had for Rodrigo, has increased, since the crown
of Castile first encircled my brow, and especially since, with
his aid, I reduced to obedience the Moors of Aragon and
conquered Don Ramiro. How invaluable were his advice
and his sword to me at that time! It seemed to me that,
having the Cid at my side, there was no enterprise that I
could not bring to a successful issue; it seemed to me, that
if the entire earth declared war against me, I could conquer it
with the aid of the Cid."</p>

<p>Don Sancho was interrupted by the entrance of one of his
servants who announced to him the arrival at the Alcazar of
a deputation from the Castilian nobility, which solicited an
audience. Don Sancho gave orders that those nobles should
be admitted to his presence.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the Count of Cabra and some more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
those whom we have seen assembled in the Castle of Carrion
stood in the presence of the king.</p>

<p>"Sire," said Don Garcia, with all the marks of profound
respect, "many nobles, your vassals, have sent us to you to
offer their congratulations on the glorious triumphs which you
have recently won in Aragon."</p>

<p>"Triumphs," replied the king, "which the Castilian nobility
have helped me to win, by accompanying me in the campaign
and fighting bravely."</p>

<p>The Count of Cabra and those who were with him perceived
at once the reproach which Don Sancho had aimed at them,
and were on the point of exhibiting their vexation; they restrained
themselves, however; and Don Garcia continued, as if
he had not noticed the irony which was contained in the words
of the king&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sire, the nobles who have commissioned us to bring you
their salutations do not belong to the number of those who
followed you to Aragon."</p>

<p>"Who then are they, Don Garcia?"</p>

<p>The Count of Cabra began to give the names of his friends.</p>

<p>"Have you not told me that you come on the part of the
Castilian nobility?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sire, for the nobles I have named are the most
exalted amongst them."</p>

<p>"And the most exalted nobles of Castile remained quietly in
their castles whilst their king was fighting against the enemies
of God and of their country?"</p>

<p>"Sire, the grandees who salute you have given abundant
proofs of their valour and of their devotion to their king; if
they did not accompany you to the war of Aragon it was
because years, infirmities, or urgent private affairs did not
permit it. Besides, sire, they believe that, if the king keeps
them at a distance and does not seek their counsels, he does
not require their aid when he engages in important enterprises,
such as that of making war on foreign states."</p>

<p>Indignation coloured the visage of Don Sancho, who interrupted
the Count of Cabra, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"As God lives, I shall chastise the audacity of the subjects
who thus insult their lord! Let both you and those who sent
you understand clearly, that the King of Castile will not
tolerate any fault-finding from his vassals."</p>

<p>"Sire, it is not our desire to find fault with you, but to
beseech you to show that consideration towards us which our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
exalted position merits, and which was always shown to our
ancestors; we desire that in the Court of Castile there should be
favours for all nobles, and not for a few, or rather for one only."</p>

<p>"What is this you say to your king, traitors?"</p>

<p>"Sire!" exclaimed almost all of the nobles present, in
indignation, "what is this you say to us? You have stained the
honour of the most noble cavaliers of Castile."</p>

<p>"No, they are not nobles who dare to impose laws on their
sovereign, who dare to speak before him in the outrageous
and arrogant way in which you have spoken!" replied Don
Sancho, not less irritated than those who were listening to
him.</p>

<p>"It would be a stain on our honour," continued the Count
of Cabra, abandoning entirely the affected humility with which,
at first, he had addressed the king,&mdash;"it would be a stain on
our honour if we were not to bring our complaints before you
with the frankness which befits good cavaliers. You offend us,
sire, by keeping us away from your Alcazar, forgetting what is
due to us, and the right we have to share in the favours which
you lavish on De Vivar and his friends, in order that you may
retain their support."</p>

<p>"Silence, silence! and do not dare to profane with your lips
the name of the Cid Campeador, or the names of his friends
and mine! I understand your desire; you would withdraw
from my side the most honoured cavalier of Castile, the
strongest pillar of my throne, the best servant of my father, the
terror of the enemies of the Christian faith? Depart from my
presence, for anger burns in my heart at seeing before me men
with such despicable souls as yours."</p>

<p>"Sire, recognise what we are, and what our rights are!"</p>

<p>"Justice of God!" exclaimed Don Sancho, now no longer
able to restrain his anger. "Must I tolerate that traitor vassals
should threaten me in my own palace? No, as God lives, no!
there are executioners in my Court who this very day shall
make your heads roll in the dust!" Then, turning towards the
door of the apartment, he called out in a loud voice, "My
guards hither! My guards hither!"</p>

<p>About a dozen archers immediately appeared, to whom the
king said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lead off these traitor nobles and shut them up in a prison,
from which they shall only come forth to the scaffold."</p>

<p>The archers were about to obey the king, when those men,
who had showed themselves so audacious only a few moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
before, bent their knees before the enraged monarch, stricken
with terror&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon, sire, pardon!"</p>

<p>Don Sancho made a sign to the archers to retire, and darting
a glance at the nobles, which expressed both the contempt and
indignation that filled his soul, he said to them&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rise, despicable cowards; men as noble as you say you
are should not touch the floor with their immaculate brows.
Be off from my sight; such baseness afflicts my soul. Depart
from my Court at once, and never return to it, for if my eyes
rest on you again, they shall be as those of the basilisk, which
kills by its glances."</p>

<p>The counts hastened to quit the Alcazar, and even the city,
with all the haste which the king had commanded.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE PEASANT OF BARBADILLO WENT TO BURGOS, WITH
OTHER THINGS WHICH THE READER WILL LEARN</p></blockquote>


<p>We must now cast a rapid glance on the mansion of De Vivar,
for none of its inhabitants deserve to be forgotten; we shall
not, however, penetrate into the principal apartments, for in
the entrance-hall we shall meet those who will engage our
attention for a brief period. Fernan and Alvar were there,
chatting in a friendly manner: we must certainly lend some
attention to their conversation, for it is not altogether foreign
to the story which we are endeavouring to relate.</p>

<p>"Is it long since you were at Vivar?" asked Alvar.</p>

<p>"I have been there twice since we returned from Aragon."</p>

<p>"And did you go to the house of Pero?"</p>

<p>"Of course; our master and mistress are so fond of Beatrice
that they would never forgive me if I were not to bring them
tidings of her and her family whenever I happen to be near the
dwelling of Pero."</p>

<p>"And what about Beatrice? Is she as gentle and beautiful
as at the time when you and I caught fire from the glances of
her eyes?"</p>

<p>"More so than even then, brother."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anger of God! how fortunate that Martin Vengador is to
have won the love of such a splendid girl!"</p>

<p>"And how much more fortunate he is to have gained so
much favour in the eyes of our master!"</p>

<p>"Don Rodrigo certainly thinks a great deal of that youth.
You saw what a large share of the booty he assigned to him
after the campaign in Aragon."</p>

<p>"And his generosity did not stop there with regard to that
Martin."</p>

<p>"What? Has he bestowed additional favours on him?"</p>

<p>"He has promised to do so on the occasion of his marriage
with Beatrice."</p>

<p>"And what favours are those, Fernan?"</p>

<p>"Don Rodrigo and Doña Ximena are to be groomsman and
brideslady at the wedding of Martin and Beatrice; and they
are to receive as gifts, for themselves and their descendants, a
house and excellent lands on the estate of Vivar."</p>

<p>"Do you know what you should do?"</p>

<p>"What, Alvar?"</p>

<p>"Marry Mayorica, before their wedding, and see if our lord
and lady will give you as valuable gifts as they will give to that
youth."</p>

<p>"They would give them to me, for they are liberal to those
who serve them faithfully."</p>

<p>"Well, if it is so, why don't you marry?"</p>

<p>"I shall do so very soon, Alvar: yesterday I promised
Mayorica, who is mad to be married, for she says that if she
cannot get me to church now, while she is still young and
comely, she won't be able to do so later on. Her complaints
almost upset my patience."</p>

<p>"And will you keep your promise to her?"</p>

<p>"I have made it, and I shall keep it, although I was never
so much against it as now."</p>

<p>"May the Moors kill me if I understand you! Why should
you be unwilling to get married, when you are well off, when
you can have a gentle and loving bride, and hopes of rich
presents? Is not Mayorica pleasing to you?"</p>

<p>"She pleases me as much as ever, Alvar, but&mdash;listen, for I am
about to confide a great secret to your discretion."</p>

<p>Fernan looked round to see if there was anyone present who
might hear him, and, not seeing anyone, he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must know, comrade, that some time ago I saw a girl
whose charms would set a heart of stone on fire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>"What? Perchance that girl from Albarracin has come to
Burgos, she whom you fell in love with when we were
stationed there during the last campaign?"</p>

<p>"No, brother, it is not that one. I should wish indeed that
the girl from Albarracin were here, for I think of her night
and day. She whom I have fallen in love with in Burgos
comes from Barbadillo, and I swear to you that she seems to
have come from heaven, so beautiful is she!"</p>

<p>"There is also a girl from Barbadillo for whom I sigh."</p>

<p>"From Barbadillo? I vow by Judas Iscariot that it would be
a nice thing if.... Where did you see her, tell me?"</p>

<p>"At the forge of Master Iñigo"&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub I'll cudgel you if you have dared
to cast your eyes where I have set mine; it was also in the
forge of Master Iñigo that I saw the girl I told you of. What
kind is she, Alvar?"</p>

<p>"Dark-complexioned."</p>

<p>"So is mine."</p>

<p>"Black eyes."</p>

<p>"So has mine also."</p>

<p>"A fine figure."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Strong hands."</p>

<p>"Just like mine."</p>

<p>"For she made my face smart with a blow, when I began
to talk amorously to her."</p>

<p>"My girl did just the same to me! Traitor! How
have you dared"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, my friend, if I did not know"&mdash;</p>

<p>"You shall know now, if you have forgotten, what my hands
are able to do."</p>

<p>And Fernan seized the page by the back of the neck with
the force of a pair of pincers.</p>

<p>On hearing the cries of the page, Mayor came out on the
top of the flight of stairs, and as she saw that Fernan did not
perceive her, so much was he intent on venting his rage on
Alvar, she stopped, in order to try to discover the origin of
the quarrel, which doubtless she suspected.</p>

<p>"Traitor!" exclaimed Fernan. "I am never to love a
woman, but you must needs fall in love with her also? You
shall die by my hand!"</p>

<p>And the squire not only plied his hands on the page, but
also his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me go, Fernan; I swear to you I shall never speak
another word to that peasant girl from Barbadillo, nor indeed
to any woman, born or to be born"&mdash;</p>

<p>"That oath saves you," said Fernan, letting him loose; "but
I assure you, Alvar, that you shall answer for it to me if you
ever try to gain the love of that pretty girl for whom I sigh."</p>

<p>"Ah, traitor! oh, false one! This, then, is the fidelity
which you swore to me only yesterday!" exclaimed Mayor, no
longer able to restrain her anger, and coming down the flight
of stairs with two jumps, her hands clenched and her eyes
flaming.</p>

<p>Fernan receded a few steps, terrified, as if he wished to fly
from that fury, by whose hands he felt himself gripped with
almost as much force as Alvar had been by his.</p>

<p>"Traitor! Do you forget me, thus turning your back on
me? I shall take care that you remember me as long as you
live." And Mayor, with her nails, made the blood run from the
neck and face of her faithless lover, who, despite his enormous
strength, which he used to its fullest, could not free himself
from her.</p>

<p>"Get away from me, wench, or I shall strike and kick you!"
cried the unlucky squire, whose strength prevailed at last.
Mayor let him go, and, from a shove which Fernan gave her,
fell against the bottom of the stairs, receiving a blow on the
head which deprived her of consciousness.</p>

<p>Fernan raised his foot to kick Mayor, as he had threatened,
but, seeing her motionless, he examined her, and, seeing that
blood was flowing from her head, became frightened. His
anger suddenly changed to grief and the most violent despair.</p>

<p>"Mayorica! Mayorica! my darling, return to yourself!
pardon me!" cried the deeply afflicted squire, endeavouring
to raise the young woman; seeing, however, that she was not
recovering, he began to tear his hair and strike his head and
face, as if he had lost his reason.</p>

<p>"I have killed her! I have murdered her! I am a barbarian,
I am a villain! I am a treacherous assassin! Kill me, Alvar,
kill me, and kill at once that peasant girl who is to blame for
this misfortune."</p>

<p>Alvar, far from killing anyone, was endeavouring to save
Mayor's life; he was bathing her face with water, which,
fortunately, was near at hand, and bandaging her face with his
pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p>At last she recovered consciousness and arose, breaking out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
not into abuse of her lover, but into wailings capable of moving
to compassion even the stone against which her head had
struck. Fernan redoubled his caresses and promises of
amendment, with which he succeeded in consoling her a little,
although Mayor knew well how soon the squire usually forgot
his oaths.</p>

<p>A moment after, the entrance-hall was deserted, for Fernan
and Alvar had disappeared up the staircase, supporting Mayor;
however, in a short time a number of persons, who from the
commencement of the quarrel had been crowding to the
principal gate, approached as near it as possible, commenting
on and explaining in their own way what had happened in the
hall.</p>

<p>"The girl must have slipped on the staircase and rolled
down it," said one.</p>

<p>"No," replied another; "but she was in love at the same
time with both Fernan and Alvar, and as soon as they discovered
it they knocked the dust off each other, and then
settled their accounts with the girl."</p>

<p>"She who got the blow is not the cause of the quarrel; it is
a peasant girl from Barbadillo."</p>

<p>"Whoever it is, I swear by all that's holy that women are the
ruin of men. May I be confounded if, from this day forward,
I believe in even the best of them."</p>

<p>"All men should do the same, master soldier."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are falser than Judas himself."</p>

<p>"It is men who are false; they fall in love with us, two at a
time, and even that isn't enough for them."</p>

<p>"Eh, my good old woman, don't take yourself into the count,
for you are out of the running."</p>

<p>"Holy Santa Gadea! Is there no one to defend an honest
matron against the insults of this ruffian of a soldier?"</p>

<p>"This soldier swears that all women are not good for much."</p>

<p>"You insolent, shameless fellow!" cried out a loud chorus
of women, who rushed furiously on him who had levelled that
insult at them, and scratched and mauled him without giving
him time to defend himself.</p>

<p>The men rushed to the aid of the soldier, who, in the end,
found himself free from those furies, and went off from the
crowd, well beaten, and with a face torn and bleeding.</p>

<p>At the same time a peasant approached the crowd and with
very great curiosity asked what was the cause of the assembly;
he muttered an execration when he could find out nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
distinctly, for what one said was in complete contradiction to
the explanations of another. His chief wish seemed to be to
get to the door, around which the people were still crowding,
to see if the heroes of the recent fight would again appear in
the entrance-hall; he then tried to force a passage for himself
with his hands and head, muttering threats and oaths at the
same time.</p>

<p>"I swear," he growled, "that even if I'm crushed to death,
I'll know what is going on, for it must be something important
when it brings so many people here, and I have not come to
the city to live in obscurity as I did in Barbadillo."</p>

<p>The execrations and exclamations became more frequent,
according as the peasant's efforts to press forward increased.</p>

<p>"Don't push us, you vile rustic!" cried some.</p>

<p>"Anger of God!" exclaimed others, "let us flatten the
clown!"</p>

<p>"Don't look on that ass as a rational creature."</p>

<p>"By all the saints in heaven, this fellow is the greatest brute
that eats bread."</p>

<p>"Push the pig back!"</p>

<p>"Sit upon the savage!"</p>

<p>"I swear that the insults of those good-for-nothing women
are putting me out of patience."</p>

<p>"It's yourselves that are good for nothing."</p>

<p>"Women are never good for anything, and by San Pedro of
Cardeña we'll soon come to blows with you."</p>

<p>"Come to blows with us?" cried several of the women, and
they made a rush on Bartolo, for it was he who was making
such violent efforts to push his way through the crowd, and
attacked him with the same fury as they had, but a short
time before, exhibited towards the soldier who had insulted
them. The peasant, who was very strong, defended himself,
knocking down a woman with each blow, and was on the
point of triumphing over his furious enemies; they, however,
cried out to the men to help them, calling them cowards, and
telling them that men are bound to render their assistance
to women. The men who were present were but few, for
curiosity, in all ages, has been the almost exclusive birthright
of women; those who were there, however, ranged themselves
on the side of the weaker sex, and attacked with sticks and
fists the man from Barbadillo, who at last surrendered at
discretion, bruised, scratched, and bleeding, so that he was
a pitiable sight to see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy who has been beaten by other boys in a street,
which is not that in which he lives, often vents his anger by
calling out to those who have maltreated him&mdash;</p>

<p>"You'll see how I'll make you pay for this when I get you
into my street."</p>

<p>And neither more nor less did the persecuted Bartolo do,
for, seeing that he was vanquished, and that there was no
possibility of his having revenge then and there, he exclaimed,
crossing his arms, moving his head from side to side, and
wishing to annihilate them all with a glance&mdash;</p>

<p>"I swear by all that's holy that I'll smash you all when I
get you in Barbadillo!"</p>

<p>"Oh, the fellow comes from Barbadillo!" said one of those
who had been there at the beginning of the quarrel between
Fernan and Alvar, and who consequently had had an opportunity
of learning something of its cause. "Barbadillo be
cursed, for the wench who was the cause of all this row comes
from it!"</p>

<p>These words aroused the curiosity of the peasant, who, as
we have seen, did not need much to excite it.</p>

<p>"Keep yourself quiet," said Bartolo to himself, "and you'll
discover something that will give annoyance to the Barbadillo
people, in return for what they have said respecting your going
often to the city, that you were outrageously curious, and that
you neglected your wife and property to stick your nose into
other people's affairs."</p>

<p>And approaching, very quietly, him who was cursing
Barbadillo, and who indeed was the soldier whom the women
had beaten so severely, he said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friend, I am from Barbadillo, but I would rather belong to
the country of the Moors than to that wretched village, which,
without doubt, God cursed as a punishment for the strife between
the Infantes of Lara, which commenced in it. Then she, you
say, who caused all this row is from Barbadillo? I swear she
couldn't be from any other place."</p>

<p>This agreement in their views gained for Bartolo the
sympathy of the soldier.</p>

<p>"What! you know nothing of the cause of the fight?" said
the latter.</p>

<p>"You will please me much by relating to me what took
place; I know you will do so, for you are more polite than
this vulgar crew," replied the peasant.</p>

<p>"Then you must know," said the soldier, "that two servitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
of the Cid are in love with a girl from Barbadillo, and they
have fought and cudgelled each other as the result of a dispute
as to which of them should have her."</p>

<p>"I swear that she must be no great things of a girl when
she throws eyes at both of them. The women of Barbadillo,
my friend, are just that kind; there's the daughter of old
mother Valeta, who, they say, fell in love with four."</p>

<p>"According to that, comrade, you should not choose a wife
from that place."</p>

<p>"It is from it that I have mine; but I have come with her to
live in Burgos, for I am very fond of knowing what is going on
in the world, such as one can learn who lives in a city, and I
go every day to the forge of Master Iñigo to hear the news
that's going round. My wife goes with me, though I find it
hard to get her to do so, but wish to polish her up a bit, and
it happened the other day that a knave of a squire began to
make love to her while I was talking to Iñigo, and she told
me, for I saw nothing of it, that she broke the fellow's teeth
with a blow of her fist You see by that what an honest
woman my wife is."</p>

<p>"Honesty be hanged!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, friend?"</p>

<p>"I mean that your wife is the very one that the two men
were fighting about."</p>

<p>"San Pedro de Cardeña, help me!"</p>

<p>"And it is quite certain that, even if the first time she
received them with blows, she must have shown herself kinder
to them afterwards, for, if not, they would not have fought so
furiously on account of her."</p>

<p>"I swear I'll kill that false woman!" exclaimed the enraged
rustic, tugging at his hair with rage.</p>

<p>As some of the bystanders had heard his conversation with
the soldier, all of them knew very soon the cause of his despair,
and it was at once intensified by a fearful chorus of hisses, of
coarse jokes, and of abuse.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Bartolo faced the crowd defiantly; his
words, however, were lost amid the hisses and the loud voices,
and then there was no remedy but to open a way for himself
and fly, mad, raging, careless as to consequences.</p>

<p>The crowd remained in its position, as those who composed
it desired to learn the result of the quarrel between the
servitors of De Vivar, for they wished to know for certain, as
already began to be whispered, if the waiting-woman of Doña<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Teresa had died of the blow which the squire had given
her.</p>

<p>The gallop of a horseman was heard, just then, on the road
leading from the Alcazar, and it was soon perceived that it
was a king's messenger who was approaching the residence of
the Cid in great haste; and he, seeing that the crowd was but
slowly opening a passage for him, broke through it, his horse
knocking some of the people down.</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards the Cid was proceeding towards
the Alcazar, accompanied by Guillen, Fernan, and Alvar, and
the people hastened to withdraw, actuated by a feeling of
respect, but perhaps chiefly because they had lost all hopes
of satisfying their curiosity, and of seeing the squire and the
page engage in a fresh quarrel.</p>

<p>Don Sancho, who, as soon as the Count of Cabra and the
other conspirators had departed from his presence, had sent
to summon Rodrigo, was awaiting him with impatience, for,
although he felt that he should chastise those audacious men,
he did not wish to do so without consulting the Cid on such
a serious matter. The king also desired to obtain the advice
of his mother, and that is why Doña Sancha was at his side
when Rodrigo arrived.</p>

<p>"My good Cid," said Don Sancho on seeing him, "the
Count of Cabra and other noblemen have but just now left
the Alcazar. I suppose you think they came to offer me their
swords to fight against the Moorish power?"</p>

<p>"Sire," replied Rodrigo, "that is what nobles like Don
Garcia should do; but neither he nor his friends did so when
you set out for the campaign of Aragon, and I doubt much
if they have done it now."</p>

<p>"You are right; those wrongly named noblemen, far from
coming to offer their king the aid of their arms, came to insult
him, to threaten him, to impose laws on him."</p>

<p>"God's anger! what traitors they are!" exclaimed Rodrigo,
unable to restrain his anger; but sorry for having failed in
the moderation and proper restraint which the presence of
his king and of the widow of Fernando the Great required, he
bent his knee respectfully and added&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon, sire; pardon me if I have been wanting in respect
to you."</p>

<p>"Arise, Rodrigo," said Don Sancho, holding out his hand
to the Cid, "arise, for your very indignation proves that you
are a good vassal and a good cavalier."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>De Vivar, emboldened by this kindness, continued, giving
reins to his just indignation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell me, sire, in what way have they offended you;
although it is sufficient for me to know that they have done
so, and I have a sword to fight with them&mdash;to avenge you or
to die! Is it not enough that De Cabra, De Carrion, and
their partisans should be always in revolt against Castile with
their cowardly plots, and never draw a sword against the
enemies of their country, but that they should come barefacedly
to insult you in your Alcazar?"</p>

<p>"No, Rodrigo, my indulgence does not suffice them; it
is not sufficient for them that their king should pardon them
their neglect of everything that cavaliers should do: they
want me to lavish favours on them; they desire to occupy the
best positions in my Alcazar; they wish that Castile should
be governed by laws dictated by their caprice and ambition;
they demand that all those should be removed from my side
who have loyally served and advised me, and you, especially,
my good Cid&mdash;it is you who are the principal object of their
hatred."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised to hear that those counts hate me, for I
have known that for a long time. As long as their cowardly
attempts were directed against me alone, I despised them. I
did not desire to appeal to my king for help to defend myself
or for the punishment of my enemies; but now when, to make
war against me, they desire to wage it against you also, I feel
bound to reveal to you the cowardly treachery of those men,
and to urge you to punish them."</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, Rodrigo Diaz put his hand into
the pouch which hung from his girdle, and took from it
some sheets of parchment which he handed to the king,
adding&mdash;</p>

<p>"See here, sire, the propositions which the Counts of Cabra
and of Carrion made to Abengalvon and to the other Moorish
kings, my friends, when we were marching against the allies
of the Emperor of Germany."</p>

<p>The king read the letters in a low voice. In them it was
proposed to the Moorish kings to get up a plot against the
Cid on the first occasion that might present itself, and kill him.
In order to induce them to do this Don Suero and Don Garcia
employed the grossest calumnies, asserting that the Cid was
working in an underhand way, under the guise of friendship,
and abusing their confidence, to dispossess Abengalvon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the other Moorish kings of their states. They also promised
them liberal rewards.</p>

<p>"Traitors, cowardly counts!" exclaimed at the same time
both Don Sancho and his mother.</p>

<p>"Abengalvon and the other Moors," continued Rodrigo,
"although infidels, placed these letters in my hands, indignant
not only on account of the malice of those counts, but also on
account of the insult inflicted on them by supposing them
capable of such perfidious conduct towards their best friend&mdash;against
him, who, having taken them captives in fair war,
restored to them their liberty, without imposing any conditions
whatsoever on them. And that, sire, was not the first time
that De Cabra and De Carrion had endeavoured to disembarrass
themselves of me. A short time before the campaign beyond
the Pyrenees, when I was proceeding to the Cortes at Leon,
Martin Antolinez, Guillen of the Standard, and myself were
enticed by stratagem into an ambuscade where ten assassins,
in the pay of the Counts of Carrion and of Cabra, awaited us.
We fought, and fortune protected us, although we were so
inferior in numbers and unprepared for a combat. Amongst
the assassins there was one who, before he expired, confessed
to us who had put the assassin's steel in his hand."</p>

<p>"With their blood," cried Don Sancho, deeply indignant,
"shall those accursed traitors pay the penalty of their crimes.
Their heads shall fall on the scaffold, and even that will not
be as great a punishment as they deserve."</p>

<p>"Sire," said Rodrigo, "punish them, but do not shed their
blood; enough has been shed in the war. Banish them for ever
from Castile, and threaten them with heavier punishment if
they should ever dare to return."</p>

<p>"Yes, my son, take the advice of Rodrigo," said Doña Sancha;
"imitate the generous example of the good cavalier who
intercedes for his treacherous enemies."</p>

<p>"If the presence of those counts in Castile were only to my
prejudice," said Rodrigo, "I would not counsel you to banish
them; but they have dared to threaten you, and they will
collect bands together and plot conspiracies, which must be
prevented. Cast from the kingdom this evil seed before it
has time to germinate; but I swear to you, sire, that even with
the price of my own blood I would try to prevent the shedding
of that of my enemies."</p>

<p>"Be it so, then, Rodrigo," said Don Sancho; "the Count of
Cabra and his partisans shall leave my kingdom within four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
days, and if they do not go, we shall have no pity for them;
in that case their traitorous heads shall roll on the ground. I wish
to be good towards the good, but inexorable towards the bad;
the Castilian nobles shall have in me a friend rather than a
master, if they will correspond to my friendship; but I shall
not be subject to them, I do not desire to bear the name of
king and allow the nobles to govern the kingdom."</p>

<p>"Thus," said the Cid, "Castile will be powerful and happy
as in the time of your father, and like him you will merit the
name of 'the Great.' I belong to the highest nobility of
Castile, but notwithstanding I maintain that the duty of
nobles is to aid their king, not to enslave him and paralyse
the hands which should freely guide the reins of the State."</p>

<p>On that same day Don Sancho issued an order that within
three days the Counts of Cabra and of Carrion, and about a
dozen other nobles, should depart from Castile, into perpetual
banishment, as rebels to his authority, traitors, and disturbers
of the peace of the kingdom.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE CID AVENGED HIMSELF ON THE COUNT OF CABRA</p></blockquote>


<p>Don Sancho II. had proposed to himself to rise superior to
the demands of the nobles; nevertheless, he did not cease to
consult them in matters of minor importance, for it was one
thing to listen to respectful counsels, springing from loyalty
and wisdom, and another to hear interested advice, given, as
if it were law, by men who, like the Counts of Cabra and of
Carrion, and others, merited the contempt of all honourable
men, even though they had descended from the most noble
families of the kingdom. His palace, therefore, was much
frequented by the nobility, and Don Sancho took great pleasure
in being surrounded by the Castilian nobles.</p>

<p>He had invited many of them to his Alcazar in Burgos on
the day following that on which he had signed the order for
the banishment of the Count of Cabra and his partisans; he
made known to his visitors the steps which he had taken, and
they all approved of them, agreeing with Rodrigo Diaz that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the king should govern, without being plotted against by
either nobles or plebeians.</p>

<p>Shortly after the nobles had retired from his presence, the
king was conversing in a very friendly way with the Cid, whom
he had ordered to remain a little longer by his side, for the
company of De Vivar was always pleasing to him; just then
the arrival of the Count of Cabra, who solicited a brief audience,
was announced.</p>

<p>"Tell him," replied Don Sancho indignantly, "that he must
depart immediately from the Alcazar, if he does not desire to
receive this very day the punishment which his audacity
merits."</p>

<p>The Cid hastened to appease the indignation of the king,
by pleading in favour of the count.</p>

<p>"Sire," he said to Don Sancho, "perhaps the Count of
Cabra, before leaving the country, wishes to give you some
information which may be of importance, concerning the peace
of the kingdom. You are justly indignant with him, but what
can you lose by hearing him? He is such a coward that he
would never hesitate to denounce even his best friend if he
considered it to his advantage to do so."</p>

<p>Don Sancho was somewhat mollified by these words, and
ordered that the count should be admitted to his presence.</p>

<p>Don Garcia entered immediately after, and, bending his knee
before the king, said in a respectful voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sire, as a good vassal, which I am, I shall submit to the
sentence of banishment which my lord and king has passed on
me; but, before departing from Castile for ever, I have
ventured to solicit your royal attention, in order to explain to
you the difficult position in which I find myself."</p>

<p>Don Sancho could not restrain his indignation in view of
the cowardice and meanness of that man, who had not sufficient
courage or dignity to submit with a calm brow to the sentence
which hung over him, as should have done even the least
honourable cavalier.</p>

<p>"Depart from my presence," he said to Don Garcia, "and
leave Castile within the time which I have mentioned, for I have
been sufficiently indulgent in leaving the head on the shoulders
of him who not alone dared to threaten me, but who paid vile
assassins to strike down the best cavalier in Spain."</p>

<p>Don Garcia was about to deny that accusation, but a glance
of the Cid sufficed to close his lips.</p>

<p>"Sire," the count ventured to say, "it would be better for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
me to die by a single stroke in Castile, than to die slowly in a
foreign country. My estates at Cabra are in the possession of
the Moors, and since I lost them I have been obliged to live
in very straitened circumstances in Castile, even though I
have friends and some little property in it. How shall I be
able to live in a foreign land, with no friends there, and no
means? Sire, if you have no compassion for me, pity at least
my wife and children, who have never offended you; revoke
the sentence of banishment which you have passed on me, or
if you consider it absolutely necessary that I should quit your
kingdom, provide me with some resources which may enable
me to procure the absolute necessaries of life."</p>

<p>"Did you not inherit from your father a sword which you
have allowed to rust in its scabbard?" replied Don Sancho.
"Brighten it again with Moslem blood, reconquer with it
your estates, and then you will not find it necessary to beg
for the means of subsistence from either your king or your
friends."</p>

<p>"My arm is much weakened by age"&mdash;</p>

<p>"By age and by inaction, not by exertion on the battlefields,"
interrupted the king.</p>

<p>The count, seeing that the king was not disposed to grant
him the favour which he had requested, asked another from
him.</p>

<p>"Sire," he said, "allow me at least to remain in Castile for
the time necessary to realise the small property I still possess,
so that I may have something to live on, in the place of my
banishment, until I may be able, by means of my sword, to
secure the well-being of myself and my family."</p>

<p>Rodrigo Diaz believed that the fears which the count
expressed, regarding the privations to which his family might
be subjected, were not ill-founded, and, forgetting the just
resentment which he nourished towards the count, he resolved
to intercede for that man, who invoked the names of wife and
children&mdash;names which were so dear to himself.</p>

<p>"Sire," he said to the king, "as you denied to the Count
of Cabra the previous favour he asked from you, I pray you
to grant him the request which he now makes, and that you
extend to a month the period within which he must depart
from Castile; I guarantee to you that within that time your
will shall be accomplished."</p>

<p>Shame and disdain should have been pictured on the
visage of the count if he were a good cavalier; but Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Garcia did not know that noble pride, that dignity which
prevents an honourable man from accepting a favour from an
enemy. The count would have knelt down before De Vivar
had not the king been present.</p>

<p>"Be it so," replied Don Sancho; "I grant the request
which you make, but woe to him if he shall not have departed
from my kingdom before the end of the month."</p>

<p>"Your will shall be done," replied Don Garcia, with
humility; "thanks, sire"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank the Cid," interrupted Don Sancho disdainfully,
"for it is to please De Vivar, and not you, that I have
extended the period, before the end of which you are to quit
Castile."</p>

<p>Rodrigo Diaz expressed to the king the pleasure he felt in
having his request granted, and Don Sancho loaded him with
praise and gave him signal proofs of friendship in the presence
of the Count of Cabra, in order to humiliate him, by showing
how far his intention was from refusing favours to the Cid, as
those nobles, who were now sentenced to banishment, wished
him to do.</p>

<p>On the same day Rodrigo Diaz said to the king&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have another favour to ask of you, sire."</p>

<p>"You know, good Cid, how delighted I always am to
please you."</p>

<p>"Happily," continued Rodrigo, "peace reigns in Castile,
and we have not to fear that it shall soon come to an end, for
some love you, and they are the majority, and the remainder
fear you. The sword of the cavalier, who can provide some
hundreds of lances, should not lie idle in its scabbard, when
there are near his country infidels, against whom he can fight,
and countries into which he can carry the Christian faith,
which is proscribed by them. You know, sire, that I can
count on many brave friends who will accompany me to the
war, and that I have a numerous body of men, whom I keep
in my pay; well, then, I wish you to give me permission to
set out for Andalucia, in order that my friends and I may
have an opportunity of escaping from the inaction which is
pressing on us in Castile."</p>

<p>"I feel much your leaving me, even for a short time,"
replied Don Sancho; "but your intentions are so honourable,
that if I opposed them I should consider myself wanting in
what is the duty of a king and of a Christian cavalier. Go,
good Campeador, to the country of the infidels, and fight as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
you always have fought, for I know that you will gain fame
thereby, not alone in Castile, but throughout all Christendom.
My father indeed was right when he said, that with a hundred
cavaliers like you he could drive the Moors from the entire
of Spain."</p>

<p>"Sire, I am only a cavalier, accustomed to conflicts, and
I must be excused if from them I hope to win a little honour
for myself, and much also for my country and the faith of
my ancestors."</p>

<p>"I envy your lot, Rodrigo," exclaimed Don Sancho, fired
with warlike enthusiasm; "the throne pleases me, because he
who is seated on it is raised above the multitude, because he
is always surrounded by splendour and grandeur, for my
heart does not feel satisfaction in small things; my soul
would desire to rule over the entire world; but I would wish
also, like you, to fly to hostile countries, freed from the cares
of a kingdom; to sleep in camps, always in armour and girded
with my sword; to breathe the air of the fields; to hear the
neighing of chargers and the sounds of the trumpets and
drums; to see the flags of the enemy floating before me, to
close with the infidels every day at the rising of the sun, to
fight for many hours without cessation, and to throw myself
for repose on Moslem standards, lulled to sleep by the chants
of victory, and by the cheers of the enthusiastic people, who
crown with laurel the brows of conquerors. Such, Rodrigo,
is the liberty and the glory which my soul ardently desires;
that is why I envy your lot, for it is in your power to achieve
that glory and to enjoy that liberty."</p>

<p>"You also, sire, will gain them," answered Rodrigo,
participating in the enthusiasm of the king; "you are young,
and have abundant time to devote yourself to a soldier's life.
What happiness, what glory, what prosperity may not Castile
hope for during the reign of the successor of Fernando the
Great!"</p>

<p>"Rodrigo," cried the Cid, with joy and emotion, "you not
alone serve your king with the sword but also with the tongue.
Your words fill my heart with the noblest ambition and with
the sweetest hopes, which must bear excellent fruit."</p>

<p>On the same day the Cid commenced his preparations for
an expedition against the infidels; he summoned all the
friends who desired to follow him, and very soon he had an
army collected, strong both in numbers and in the bravery
of those who composed it. In it were Martin Antolinez,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Alvar Fañez Minaya, Guillen of the Standard, Diego Ordoñez
de Lara, the cousins of the Cid, and numerous other cavaliers;
it is almost unnecessary to mention that Martin, formerly the
Vengador, Rui-Venablos, and the bandits who had formed
their band, were now in the Cid's army.</p>

<p>On other occasions Burgos had put on mourning when its
cavaliers set out for a war; but on the day to which we refer
the inhabitants of the city rejoiced, for they felt sure that the
army, under the leadership of the Cid Campeador, would
return victorious. Even Ximena, whose heart was usually
full of grief whenever Rodrigo left the domestic hearth,
seemed to share in the universal pleasure and hopes; she
trusted that her husband would return from Andalucia crowned
with fresh laurels. How love, and generous and noble pride
shone in her beautiful eyes when, on taking leave of Rodrigo,
she put to his lips the smiling face of a tender baby which she
was fondling in her arms. Notwithstanding the universal
gladness and the universal hopes, there was a person in the
residence of the lords of Vivar who was weeping on account
of one of those who was about to set out in the army of the
Campeador: it was Mayor, the unhappy sweetheart of Fernan,
who was lamenting, in anticipation, over the faithlessness
which she feared from him as soon as he left her. Fernan
had repented of the rough way he had treated her a few days
before, had sworn everlasting fidelity to her by all that was
most sacred in heaven and on earth, but&mdash;how could she
trust in the oaths of one who so many times had sworn
similar ones, and so many times had broken them?</p>

<p>The Cid Campeador departed with his army from Burgos.
Almenon, King of Toledo, willingly permitted him to pass
through his dominions, in order that he might continue in
peace with Castile as in the time of Don Fernando; and as
he was at war just then with his co-religionists of Andalucia.</p>

<p>When the latter learned that the Campeador was advancing
on them, the note of alarm was sounded, and collecting together
a numerous army, they hastened to Sierra Morena, in
order to oppose the advance of the Castilians. The Cid well
knew the advantage he would derive if he could triumph over
the infidels in that first encounter, and prepared, therefore, to
attack the enemy with greater impetuosity and valour than he
had ever before displayed, although his men were inferior in
numbers.</p>

<p>When the Moors confidently hoped that the Castilians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
would refrain from advancing, if, indeed, they did not retreat,
they found themselves attacked with such fury that they had
to fall back for a considerable distance. However, the
Christians were few in number compared with them, and
shame infused sufficient valour into their hearts to prevent
them from retreating, so that they swore that they would die
rather than abandon the field of battle. Then the combat
began anew with fierce determination on both sides. The
conflict lasted many hours, and infidel blood, mixed with that
of the Christians, ran in torrents; but some supernatural
power seemed to aid the Christians,&mdash;even though the Moors
opposed twenty cavaliers to each of those of the Cid,&mdash;and
gave the victory to the latter, deciding it in such a way,
that but few of the infidels escaped from the weapons of the
Castilians.</p>

<p>The army of the Cid collected the spoils, which were very
valuable, and having divided them, advanced with stronger
resolution, with fresh hopes of conquering in all battles in
which they might be engaged.</p>

<p>The Campeador then proceeded in the direction of Cabra.
Why should he select the conquest of that place in preference
to that of other fortresses nearer to him, and easier to subdue?
"The reason," said his cavaliers, "is that he wishes to be
able to say to his enemy, the Count of Cabra, 'See, I have
been able to conquer what you were not able to defend; with
a few hundred men I have taken the place which you were
not able to retain with several thousands; you have not, in
reality, been Count of Cabra for a long time, but I am so
now; give up that title, of which you have been so proud, for
it no longer belongs to you.'"</p>

<p>The army of the Cid arrived at last in the territory of
Cabra; the frontiers were guarded by watch-towers and
garrisoned ramparts; these fortresses fell into the power of
the Castilians in a very short time, and although the governor
of the town asked for aid from the neighbouring Moors, he
asked for it in vain, for they, disheartened by the defeat at
Sierra Morena, and others which they had afterwards suffered,
were only intent on repairing their fortifications and preparing
themselves for their own defence, in case, as they feared, they
might be attacked by the Castilians.</p>

<p>The town of Cabra was very strong, both on account of its
defences and the number of soldiers who garrisoned them
when Don Garcia lost it, but in both respects it was even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
stronger when the Cid advanced to reconquer it; but that did
not cause De Vivar to waver in his resolution to lay siege to
it. Having taken their position, the Castilians found that they
were unprovided with sufficient warlike machines to break
down the formidable walls, but brave hearts never let themselves
be foiled by obstacles: such, indeed, were only incentives
to the Cid. The besiegers required battering-rams, catapults,
and scaling ladders, and they provided themselves with them
in a very short time. They then placed them in position, and
the place was attacked in many places. Its defenders were
brave and numerous, and were supplied with powerful means
of defence; the walls of Cabra were always crowded with
soldiers, who continually cast forth clouds of death-dealing
projectiles; the Cid, however, got his men ready for the
assault. The walls had been weakened at four different
points; at these four points the Cid determined to assault the
town simultaneously, and he did so.</p>

<p>The Castilians and Moslems fought bravely, bloodily, and
ferociously on the walls of Cabra; but at the end the army of
the Cid poured into the town, and although the infidels,
having abandoned the walls, defended, step by step, the streets
and houses, the sacred Cross shone, on the same day, above
the Moslem minarets, and Rodrigo Diaz could name himself
Count of Cabra.</p>

<p>Enormous were the riches which the Moors had accumulated
in that town, and consequently the spoils of the conquerors
were very great. Rodrigo made the partition of all these
valuable things, reserving the fifth part for the king, as was
the custom, and only for himself the territory which he had
conquered, although by right he could claim not only it, but
also the larger part of the spoils. All those, therefore, who
had taken part in the victory considered themselves very
liberally treated, and broke out into enthusiastic cheers for
their valiant and generous leader.</p>

<p>The Cid then put the fortifications of Cabra into a good
state of repair, and having arranged that it should be garrisoned
by two hundred soldiers, selected from his army, and commanded
by Guillen of the Standard and Martin the Vengador,
he prepared to return to Castile with the remainder of his
army.</p>

<p>How joyful were the Cid and his companions when returning
to their own country!</p>

<p>By travelling in a leisurely way four days would be necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
to get to Burgos; the Cid, however, remembered that it
wanted but two days of a month, from the time he had set out
for Andalucia; and he became very uneasy, and accelerated
the march. They went on, therefore, day and night, with but
little rest, and came within sight of Burgos before the end of
the two days.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me, Fernan," asked Alvar, "why we travelled
so leisurely at first, and why our master gives us no rest
now?"</p>

<p>"It puzzles me," answered the squire, "unless it is that the
Count of Cabra and his partisans have commenced hostilities,
and our master wishes to subdue them."</p>

<p>"That cannot be, comrade, for the partisans of De Garcia
had to leave Castile almost at the same time as we did; and
although the Count of Cabra had permission from the king to
remain in it a month longer, his friends being away, he could
not venture to attempt anything on his own account."</p>

<p>"You are right, Alvar; but&mdash;I swear by Judas Iscariot, I
have just hit upon the reason why our master has journeyed
so rapidly. On this very day Don Garcia must be off, bag
and baggage; Don Rodrigo has made haste to get to Burgos
before he leaves, in order that he may throw in his face the
loss of his title of Count of Cabra, and tell him a few plain
truths which will bring the colour to his cheeks."</p>

<p>"You are right, Fernan; it must be that."</p>

<p>"I doubt whether I most rejoice at having arrived in Burgos
to see Mayorica, or to hear the pretty things which my master
will say to Don Garcia."</p>

<p>"I would offer four masses to Santa Gadea that my master
might find Don Garcia still in Burgos."</p>

<p>"And I the same, Alvar."</p>

<p>Fernan and Alvar had arrived at this point of their
conversation when they came in full view of the city.</p>

<p>The army was at but a very short distance from Burgos,
when those that composed it saw a number of cavaliers issuing
from one of its gates and coming towards them. The Cid,
who was riding in the front, was the first to notice those who
were leaving the city, and was much rejoiced to find that they
were Don Garcia, with some of his friends and retainers.</p>

<p>The Count of Cabra, the time being just completed which
the king had fixed for his departure, was leaving Burgos, in
order to quit Castile.</p>

<p>The haste with which the army of the Cid had marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
was the reason that his arrival was not known in Burgos, and
that the citizens had not thronged out to meet him; but just
as Don Rodrigo and Don Garcia met, the city was becoming
deserted, as its inhabitants were hastening out in swarms to
welcome the victorious army.</p>

<p>Don Garcia, who had already learned that the Cid had
taken possession of the states of Cabra, could not disguise his
vexation, his anger, his envy, his despair at the sight of Rodrigo.
He was a coward, and for that reason would not have dared,
on any other occasion, to excite the anger of Rodrigo, but the
rage which then burned within him made him reckless.</p>

<p>"You come in good time, De Vivar," he said to Rodrigo;
"you continue to clothe yourself in the skin of a lamb in order
that none may know that you are a fox."</p>

<p>"San Pedro of Cardeña!" murmured the Cid, placing his
hand on his sword, unable to keep in his anger on hearing that
insult; but he at once restrained himself, and Don Garcia
continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can he be called a good cavalier who prayed the king to
extend the time before my banishment that he might be able
to insult me in my misfortunes, by saying, 'Quit Castile, not
only without property, but also without the name of your
ancestors, for that name is now mine; from this day forward I
shall adorn myself with it'? Some day you shall know how
terrible is the vengeance of the cavalier who has been so
cruelly treated."</p>

<p>"You know, Don Garcia," answered the Cid, still restraining
his anger, "that in all Castile there is no cavalier who should
doubt of my loyalty less than you. Do not force me to throw
publicly in your face the insults with which you sought to
stain my honour."</p>

<p>"The day of my revenge will come, and then&mdash;beware of
me, De Vivar."</p>

<p>"You have abundance of proof of your impotence to revenge
yourself on me. I do not fear your vengeance, even if, to
carry it out, you use means as base as those which you and
your friends have already practised."</p>

<p>"My vengeance can never be as base as yours."</p>

<p>"Don Garcia!" exclaimed the Cid in a loud voice, "you
shall now learn how Rodrigo de Vivar avenges himself on
those who have injured him, who have hated him, and who
have paid assassins to plunge their daggers in his heart. You
are leaving Castile, banished, not knowing whither to go in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
order to weep over your misfortunes. Proceed now to your
estates of Cabra, for if you did not know how to defend them,
I have been able to reconquer them for you. If you do not
consider yourself strong enough to protect them from the
Moors, you will find there Guillen of the Standard, Martin
Vengador, and two hundred soldiers, who will be able to defend
your states against all the Moors in Andalucia. Now do you
understand why I besought Don Sancho to extend the time,
before the end of which you should go from Castile into exile,
from four days to a month?"</p>

<p>The Count of Cabra, stupefied by astonishment and joy,
murmured some words of gratitude, and, urging on his horse
towards Rodrigo, he held out his hand to him; but the Cid
did not hear those words, which were drowned by the
acclamations of the multitude, which had been quickly
approaching; nor did he extend his hand to take that of Don
Garcia, for, as soon as he had pronounced his last words, he
set spurs to Babieca and continued his way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW THE COUNT OF CARRION WOUND THE SKEIN AND
HOW OTHERS UNWOUND IT</p></blockquote>


<p>The Count of Carrion had some friends in Toro, and he proceeded
thither, two days after he had received the sentence of
banishment pronounced by Don Sancho, leaving his sister
in the castle under the guard of his accomplice, Bellido
Dolfos.</p>

<p>Doña Elvira, the mistress of Toro, was a young princess, as
unsuspecting as she was good, and this being known to Don
Suero and his partisans, they determined, at any cost, to make
themselves masters of her will, in order to establish at Toro the
centre of their operations; for they had resolved to get up a
conspiracy against Don Sancho, in order to avenge themselves
for the sentence of banishment which he had passed on them.
They made the Infanta believe that she was surrounded by
dangers, that her brother harboured the design of reigning in
all the states of his late father, and that Toro was the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
which he had resolved to get possession of, as, being the
weakest, he preferred to commence in it his plans of usurpation.
"Let us cause enmity," they said, "between Doña Elvira and
Don Sancho, and he will at once endeavour to make himself
master of Toro. Don Alfonso, Don Garcia, and Doña Urraca
will take up at once the defence of their sister, fearing lest
Don Sancho would also attack their dominions, stimulated to
it by his usurpation of the state of Toro, and then the King of
Castile will lose his crown, for he will not be able to resist all
his brothers and sisters leagued against him." At the same
time they instilled distrust, regarding the intentions of Don
Sancho, into the heart of Don Alfonso, and into those of Don
Garcia and Doña Urraca, by means of trusty friends whom
they had near them. In a word, they were hatching a widespread
conspiracy, which they felt confident would enable them
to avenge themselves on the King of Castile.</p>

<p>The credulous Doña Elvira cast herself blindly into the arms
of those men, believing that she could only procure her safety
through them; so that, in a very short time, the Count of
Carrion and his partisans were much more rulers of Toro than
the daughter of Don Fernando. Such being the condition of
affairs, was it not easy for those traitors to force Doña Elvira
to declare war against Don Sancho? And having embroiled
himself with Doña Elvira, would he not also have done so
with all his brothers and sisters? And then, was not his ruin
certain?</p>

<p>Don Sancho learned that Toro was now the residence of his
bitterest foes, that they were conspiring there against Castile,
and that his sister, far from opposing the conspirators, was
aiding them by her tolerance, and even openly protecting
them. On this account he was very much irritated with Doña
Elvira, to whom he addressed frequent protests, threatening
her with the loss of her state if she did not change her
conduct.</p>

<p>Persuaded by her disloyal advisers, she replied to Don
Sancho with much haughtiness, telling him that, if he dared to
make an attempt on her state, all her brothers and sisters would
side with her, and that they would divide amongst them the
kingdom of Castile.</p>

<p>Don Sancho was easily excited to anger, but brave at the
same time. That challenge made him very indignant, with
the much more reason, as he believed that his brothers and
sisters owed the quiet possession of their states, up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
present time, to his affection and generosity&mdash;states which, he
believed, belonged by right to him. Besides, his mother,
whose counsels were the only ones which had very strong
effect on him, was not with him; he held, indeed, those of the
Cid in much esteem, but he did not always allow himself to be
blindly guided by him.</p>

<p>"My sister!" he exclaimed, filled with rage, when he had
read her letters, "thinks that I fear my brothers, but she knows
me but very imperfectly. I promised my mother not to proclaim
war against my kinsfolk, and I have kept that promise;
but if they declare war against me, I accept the issue. I do
not fail in my word. Within a few days the state of Toro shall
be mine, even though all my brothers and sisters should unite
for its defence."</p>

<p>"Sire," said Rodrigo Diaz and other cavaliers to him,
"remember the curse which your father called down on the
head of any child of his who would dare to deprive another of
them of his inheritance. You should know that Doña Elvira
is but a powerless woman, who, instead of being punished,
should be protected by you, for, in addition to being her
brother, you are powerful."</p>

<p>"I do not incur the malediction of my father by opposing
war to war," answered Don Sancho; "the curse of my father
will fall on the head of that sister or brother who insults
and challenges me. If I tolerate the arrogance and the
provocation of my sister, they will all look on me as weak and
cowardly, and some day they will all attack me, anxious to
divide my kingdom amongst them. If I let Doña Elvira and
all the others see now that I am neither weak nor a coward,
they will not abuse my generosity in the future. The state of
Toro must be mine, even though I return it to my sister
immediately after having taken possession of it."</p>

<p>The Cid endeavoured to dissuade Don Sancho from his
resolve, but his counsels were of no avail. He did not persist
in them energetically, in order not to act against the principle
which he had formerly expressed, that the king should act
without being impeded either by nobles or commoners.</p>

<p>Don Sancho then collected a large body of men-at-arms,
and was preparing to attack Toro; but just then Doña Elvira,
having sought aid from Don Garcia, who was the most powerful
of her brothers, the latter sent one of his cavaliers, named
Rui-Ximenez, to Don Sancho, challenging him to attack
the kingdom of Galicia instead of the state of Toro, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
charging him with cowardice, on account of his intention to
fall upon the weak, like Doña Elvira, instead of the strong,
like him. The vexation which this message caused Don
Sancho was much greater than that which the provocations of
Doña Elvira had occasioned.</p>

<p>The King of Castile consulted the Cid as to the reply which
he should give to his brother.</p>

<p>"Endeavour," said Don Rodrigo to him, "to avoid war
with your brother, but if he perseveres in his provocations,
make war against him, without, however, forgetting that he is
your brother; but to enter into his kingdom you must pass
through that of Leon, and to do so without the consent of
Don Alfonso would be only to make another enemy."</p>

<p>Don Sancho and Don Alfonso met in Sahagun, and arranged
that the latter should allow the Castilian army to pass through
the kingdom of Leon. As a result of this arrangement, Don
Sancho sent Alvar Fañez Minaya to challenge Don Garcia.</p>

<p>He accepted the challenge, and collected a large army, with
which he prepared to march against his brother, who was
advancing in great force towards Galicia. His soldiers,
however, who were very much discontented on account of war
having been declared against Castile, as they foresaw its
disastrous consequences, revolted at the moment of setting
out, and killed Rui-Ximenez in the presence of the king, for
they believed that it was he who had given evil counsels to
Don Garcia.</p>

<p>This occurrence caused the breaking up of the army of the
King of Galicia, and thus the Castilians penetrated into his
kingdom, and Don Sancho made himself master of several
fortified places, and especially of the entire Portuguese portion
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>After a time, however, Don Garcia mustered another large
army, and sallied forth to encounter his brother. The battle
was fierce, the two kings fighting at the fronts of their respective
troops, and after a combat, lasting for half a day, the
Castilians were thrown into disorder. Don Garcia succeeded
in making Don Sancho his prisoner, and having given him into
the charge of six of his followers, he set out in pursuit of the
fugitives.</p>

<p>"Give me my liberty, cavaliers," cried Don Sancho to those
who were guarding him, full of anger at not being able to stop
the flight of his disordered army, and of shame at finding
himself a prisoner. "Let me free, and I promise you rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
rewards, and I also give you my word that I will not cause any
further injury to your country."</p>

<p>"For all your kingdom we would not do it," replied his
guards, "for we should then be traitors to our lord and king.
You must await the return of Don Garcia, and he can act as
he pleases."</p>

<p>Alvar Fañez Minaya saw from a distance the capture of Don
Sancho, and, spurring his horse towards those who were
guarding him, he cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Traitors, set my lord and king at liberty!"</p>

<p>And as they did not show any disposition to obey him, but
were rather preparing to chastise his audacity, he rushed on
them, and unhorsed two with the first thrusts of his lance.
The other four then fled in terror; and Don Sancho, having
recovered his freedom, rode up to the top of an eminence and
cried out to his men&mdash;</p>

<p>"To me, my cavaliers! Loyal and brave Castilians, rally
around me!"</p>

<p>Four hundred cavaliers collected around him in a few
minutes, and the others, who were fighting in groups, scattered
here and there, recovered courage, and succeeded in also
joining the king.</p>

<p>The Cid, who in those wars accompanied the king, without
taking part in the conflicts, as he desired to keep the promise
which he had made to Don Fernando the Great, never to draw
his sword against a son or daughter of his, unless one was
oppressed by another and required his aid,&mdash;the Cid, we repeat,
had remained neutral, at some distance from the field of
battle; but when he became aware of the difficult position in
which Don Sancho was, he believed that he should go to his
assistance, and he appeared, with his three hundred cavaliers,
in sight of the king just as he was preparing to descend to the
plain, where the battle was continuing, with the troops which
he had been able to reunite.</p>

<p>Don Sancho saw him, and joy and hope shone in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Let us descend to the plain," he said to his cavaliers;
"for, the Cid aiding us, we shall still be able to recover our
losses, the day shall yet be ours."</p>

<p>And he added, approaching the Cid&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are welcome, Campeador. A vassal never arrived in
better time to serve his king, than you do now."</p>

<p>"Sire," replied Rodrigo, "you can count on winning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
battle. Your brother will be defeated; but you must promise
me to spare his life, should he become your prisoner."</p>

<p>"I make you that promise, good Cid," answered Don
Sancho.</p>

<p>They then descended to the plain, Don Sancho and the Cid
in the front.</p>

<p>Don Garcia, wearied by the pursuit, was returning, well
contented, and rejoicing at having defeated his brother, when,
on turning a hill, he found himself face to face with the
Castilians. The fight then recommenced, all the troops, on
both sides, reuniting.</p>

<p>That second fight was as sanguinary as the first, but shorter.
The cavaliers of the Cid succeeded in breaking up the ranks
of Don Garcia, and the Castilians were victorious.</p>

<p>The Cid took Don Garcia prisoner, and delivered him up to
Don Sancho.</p>

<p>"Don Garcia," said the latter to his brother, "tell me, on
the word of a cavalier, what fate you had reserved for me
when, a short time ago, you had me in your power, for I wish
to treat you as you would have treated me."</p>

<p>"Death!" replied Don Garcia, driven to the wildest
desperation.</p>

<p>"Your brother does not wish to shed the blood of his
brother," said the King of Castile; "your brother would
restore you to liberty, and would give back to you the
kingdom which he has won from you, if he did not fear
that you would provoke a second war, in which Christians
would shed the blood of Christians. As you cannot live free
in your Alcazar of Oviedo, live a prisoner in the Castle of
Luna."</p>

<p>"You do well to imprison me," replied Don Garcia, "as I
am now your deadliest foe, since it has been your desire to
have in me an enemy and not a brother. But those who will
free me from my prison are not wanting. The King of Leon
is still free; and the hope also remains to me that your
forehead shall be struck some day by the bolt of divine
vengeance, with which our father threatened the Cain who
would attack his brother."</p>

<p>"It is ye that are Cains, not I," exclaimed Don Sancho, in
anger; but, restraining himself, he added&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brother, refrain from insults, which can only make your
condition worse. Give me your word that you will live far
from my states, and I shall see that you want nothing where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>with
to maintain your dignity, and in exchange I will now give
you your freedom."</p>

<p>"If you give it to me, I shall use it to drag you from the
throne which you have usurped."</p>

<p>"Then you shall live and die in confinement, as you so
desire!" exclaimed Don Sancho indignantly.</p>

<p>A few days after, the unfortunate Don Garcia was
imprisoned in the Castle of Luna.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">FROM BURGOS TO VIVAR</p></blockquote>


<p>One morning in summer, shortly after sunrise, two cavaliers
set out from Burgos in the direction of Vivar; both were
young and graceful, and rode on, conversing in an animated and
pleasant tone, keeping their steeds beside each other.</p>

<p>They were Guillen of the Standard and Martin Vengador.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful morning this is!" said Guillen.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied his companion; "and how pleasant it is to
breathe the air of the fields when the sun is rising."</p>

<p>"We, who have passed our lives in the country, smother in
cities. See, Martin, how blue the sky is, listen to the singing
of the birds amid the trees of that dell, and smell the fragrance
of the plants which grow around us."</p>

<p>"This morning reminds me of the one on which we left
Cabra, the day following the arrival of the count, whom it
cost so little to have it restored to him."</p>

<p>"They say that Andalucia is a fairer land than Castile, and
certainly its fields are more fertile and its sky clearer, but may
God grant it to me to live and die in our famed Castile, for
there is no country equal to one's native land."</p>

<p>"So say I also, Guillen; besides, in our Castile there are
abundance of fertile plains, luxuriant woods, and fragrant
flowers; we also have a clear sky and a brilliant and life-giving
sun. Castile is, above all others, the land of chivalry, of
honour, and of glory. If Andalucia has an advantage over
Castile in its soil, it has not such with regard to its inhabitants;
here we let our souls be seen as naked as our fields; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
they show their souls concealed with foliage and flowers, like
the fields of that land; as in our land we have permitted
scarcely any infidels to dwell, we have preserved pure the
blood of the cavaliers of Covadonga and Roncesvalles."</p>

<p>"It delights me to wander along the banks of the Guadalquiver,
for on them the trees and flowers are most beautiful;
but it delights me more to walk on the banks of the Ebro,
of the Tormes, and of the Duero, for they are filled with
the memories of brave cavaliers and glorious feats of
arms."</p>

<p>"We cannot envy any who dwell in Spain, for God has
given us honours, of which we can justly feel proud, and great
natural riches which we can enjoy."</p>

<p>"And love adorns all, Martin; for my part, I can say that
love causes me to see flowers where others can only see rocks,
palaces where there are only huts, and angels where there are
but human beings. Does it not seem a great happiness to
you to have souls that feel as ours do, and to love so well the
land in which we were born?"</p>

<p>"And above all," said Martin, smiling pleasantly, "the love
of maidens, so worthy of being loved as your noble Doña
Teresa and my humble Beatrice."</p>

<p>Guillen sighed, and there disappeared from his face the
joy which, till then, had shone on it.</p>

<p>"Happy you, who can see, as often as you like, her whom
you love!" exclaimed the lover of the Infanta of Carrion.</p>

<p>"Guillen, the day is not far distant when your happiness
will be as complete as mine. Are you indeed discontented
with your lot?"</p>

<p>"No, Martin, no. When I think that I, a poor servitor of
the Count of Carrion, the son of a humble peasant, have been
made already a member of the order of chivalry, am treated
as an equal by the most noble cavaliers of Castile, have won
the love of the king and of the Cid, and am richer than many
of those who call themselves grandees, it seems that joy
should disturb my reason. But why should you be astonished,
Martin, that my heart becomes sad when I think of the
Infanta, whom I love more and more as days go on, and
whom I may not see for a very long time? If Doña Teresa
had a mother by her side, or even anyone who could protect
her, love her, and cheer up the sadness of her heart,
living apart from her would not be so hard to bear; but she
is in the power of her brother, nay, even worse, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
power of that traitor Bellido, since the king banished Don
Suero."</p>

<p>"But how is it possible, Guillen, that the Count of Carrion
can trust the traitor to such an extent, that he not only gives
him his friendship, but also confides to him the care of his
household? How is it possible that he should have put his
sister and his nephews in his charge, during his absence?"</p>

<p>"It appears impossible, Martin, but nothing is more certain."</p>

<p>"But how do you manage to receive news of what takes
place in the Castle of Carrion?"</p>

<p>"I hear from Doña Teresa through a domestic, named
Gonzalo, who was always devoted to his lady and to me; he
is bent on revenging himself on the count, from whom he has
received more blows than he has hairs on his head."</p>

<p>"I am astonished that Bellido permits him to absent himself
from the Castle long enough to go to Burgos."</p>

<p>"For a considerable time the count made use of him to
send letters to his friends; and when he went to Toro, where
he now is, he left him in Carrion, in order that he might
perform the same services for Bellido, spurred on now and
then by a sound cudgelling, which the count advised his friend
to apply to him, should he show himself at any time reluctant
to do his bidding. Bellido sends him rather often to Burgos,
with letters to the partisans of the exiled noblemen, for they
have still in Castile some who are desirous to aid them; also
to find out what is going on, and to act as a spy even on the
king himself."</p>

<p>"It is fortunate for you that you have such means of
communicating with the Infanta."</p>

<p>"It certainly is, for if I had them not, I swear by the name
I bear, that before this I would have attacked the Castle of
Carrion, and have either found my death or removed the
Infanta from that prison."</p>

<p>"But I think that even still we should strike a blow against
the castle, in order to free the defenceless dove from the claws
of the hawk."</p>

<p>"I am thinking of doing so, Martin; and if I have not
done so before this, it is because I feared that the attempt
might be vain; the castle is very strong in itself, and it is
defended by good crossbow-men; but I can now count on
friends who will aid me in the enterprise, even Don Rodrigo
himself will lend me his assistance, if not personally, at least
with men-at-arms, and I hope that before a year passes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
Guillen of the Standard and the Infanta of Carrion will be
united before the altar. On the day that I found you in the
wood, and induced you to go with me to the wars, if I had
said to a grandee, of even the lowest rank, that I aspired to the
hand of the Infanta of Carrion, he would have spat in my face
and looked on me as a madman; but now even the King of
Castile will support my pretensions."</p>

<p>"Blessed was the day of which you remind me, Guillen,"
exclaimed Martin, thinking of what he had been when he
commanded his band, and what he now was, in the service of
the Cid. "Blessed also be you," he added, "who, from
being a miserable bandit, made of me a soldier, whom the
Campeador honours with his friendship and confidence&mdash;he
who is the best cavalier in the world. You well said that
on the fields of battle I would be able to wash away, with
infidel blood, the stain which the world sees on the brow of
the bandit; that on them I would acquire power to chastise
the assassin of my father; that from them I would return
a hundred times more worthy to be united to the girl whom
I love."</p>

<p>"We have had many glorious days in the wars, and I hope
that we shall have many more."</p>

<p>"I pray God that we may be soon fighting once more
against the Moors, instead of in those accursed conflicts of
Christians against Christians."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, Martin, I fear that those battles, of which
you speak, are not yet terminated. As things are, I believe
that, before long, there must be more sanguinary combats
between Castilians and Leonese. I would wager the sword
which the Cid girt on me, that, within two months, there will
be a fierce war between Don Sancho and his brother Don
Alfonso. Don Sancho eagerly desires to possess the kingdom
of Leon, especially since he has acquired that of Galicia; and
Don Alfonso, who knows that, and gives ear to evil advisers,
affords every day opportunities for a rupture, by letting the
enmity appear which he feels towards Don Sancho."</p>

<p>The two young men were thus conversing when they came
in sight of Vivar; they were much rejoiced at this, for the
day, fresh and pleasant at its beginning, was becoming
oppressive, as the sun was very high, and was shooting down
his beams much fiercer than was agreeable. It was not alone
the hope of rest, shaded from the heat of the sun, that made
them anxious to see the end of their two-hours' journey, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
did not take much longer time to complete it; Martin loved
Beatrice deeply, and was returning to see her after a long
absence in the war between Don Sancho and Don Garcia, and
Guillen was about to see the happiness of his friend and
companion-in-arms, in which he rejoiced as much as if it were
his own.</p>

<p>In front of the farmhouse of Pero was a beautiful orchard,
in which was a great abundance of fruit-trees, which laborious
and happy husbandmen had planted, and made to grow and
bear fruit with their constant care; in it were standing
Beatrice and her parents when Martin and Guillen halted on
an eminence which overlooked the farmhouse.</p>

<p>On seeing them, a cry of joy escaped from the lips of
Beatrice, who let fall the fruit which she was carrying in her
turned-up skirt, and ran to meet the two young men; her
parents imitated her, for they looked on Martin as a son, and
indeed on Guillen almost as such, for the former seldom went
to Vivar without being accompanied by the latter.</p>

<p>Beatrice was soon serving an appetising meal to her guests
and her parents under a large tree in the garden, and all were
conversing pleasantly together, building castles in the air, and
abandoning themselves to a happiness which only good souls
can understand.</p>

<p>Shortly after the termination of the meal the gallop of a
horse was heard on the road which led to Carrion, and which
was only about two stone-throws from the farmhouse. All
turned their eyes in that direction, and Guillen uttered a cry
of pleasure, for in the horseman he recognised Gonzalo, the
servant of Don Suero, who now and then brought him news
from Doña Teresa.</p>

<p>Guillen ran across the orchard and went out on the road to
meet Gonzalo, who dismounted at once when he recognised
him.</p>

<p>"Gonzalo, you are indeed welcome," said Guillen, in whose
face pleasure and inquietude were depicted. "Do you come
from the Castle of Carrion?"</p>

<p>"I left it during the night," answered Gonzalo, "and I
bring you a letter from my mistress. Here it is," he said,
and he handed a parchment to the young man.</p>

<p>Guillen hastened to open it, and then read it eagerly.</p>

<p>"To-day," wrote the Infanta to him, "Bellido, my jailer
sets out for Toro, and he cannot be back for at least eight
days. Guillen, it is a long time since I saw you last, and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
a long time I feared to die without seeing you again; ask
Gonzalo, when he delivers this letter to you, when he can be
back to the castle, for, if you can come to see me, he will
facilitate your entrance into it. Have pity on me, do not
allow me to die within those gloomy walls without again seeing
you&mdash;you on whom I place the only hope which I have in
this world."</p>

<p>The loving youth pressed his lips on those lines, partly
effaced by the tears of Teresa, and felt his eyes moist, as on
that night, both sad and joyous, in which he revealed his love
to the unhappy maiden in the camp of the bandits.</p>

<p>"Gonzalo!" he exclaimed, throwing his arms round the neck
of the messenger, "if I had a hundred lives I would willingly
give them in exchange for the happiness which you have
brought me, and even then I would consider it but poorly paid!
I am no longer the humble servitor of Don Suero, such as
you formerly knew me; I have power and wealth, with which
I can recompense your services. Continue in the household
of the count, in order that you may watch over Doña Teresa;
and on the day when your mistress shall no longer have need
of your care, I will say to you, 'In future you shall not
have to go into the employment of any person; I have wealth
which I have won in the wars; take what you require in order
to live free and happy wherever you may desire!'"</p>

<p>Gonzalo was not mercenary, but how was it possible for
him not to feel happy, when he saw shining before him the
hope of being able to live as Guillen had said, instead of being
constantly exposed to the outrages and bad treatment to
which he was subjected in the service of the Count of
Carrion.</p>

<p>"My lady and you," he replied, "can dispose of me, as I
am resolved to serve both of you, as far as is in my power,
without any recompense but that of being useful to those who
need my services."</p>

<p>"Do you believe, Gonzalo, that it will be possible for me
to enter the castle during the absence of Bellido?"</p>

<p>"My lady and I have had long talks on the subject, and
we have come to the conclusion that such is possible, by
making our arrangements beforehand."</p>

<p>"When can you be in Carrion again?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow night; I am now going to Burgos with letters,
which Bellido gave me before his departure, with instructions
to go with them to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, to-morrow night, at whatever hour you now
tell me, I shall be outside the castle."</p>

<p>"At midnight you must come to the postern very cautiously,
although there is not much risk of the crossbow-men hearing
you; for, as Bellido makes them keep watch every night,
under pain of anyone who falls asleep being hung on the
battlements in the morning, they will try to make up for that
by sleeping well whilst he is away from the castle. I shall
watch for your arrival through the loopholes, and as soon as
I see you approach I will open the postern and let you in,
and will facilitate your getting through the castle, so that you
may see Doña Teresa for a short time."</p>

<p>"Very well, I shall not fail to be there to-morrow night at
the hour you have mentioned."</p>

<p>"Take care that you are not surprised by a band of robbers,
who, people say, have appeared recently in the district of
Carrion, where bandits have not been seen since the Vengador
and his men went away."</p>

<p>"All right, Gonzalo, I shall not forget your caution; I
thank you for it. What have you to tell me of the Infanta?"</p>

<p>"If her troubles do not soon cease, God will be as unjust
to her as men have been."</p>

<p>"No, Gonzalo, God is not unjust, as men often are; God
will make up for the sufferings of the Infanta with many years
of perfect happiness; tell her that, for you will see her before
I can."</p>

<p>After a few more words Guillen and Gonzalo separated, the
former returning to where Martin and the Pero family were
awaiting him, and the latter continuing his journey to Burgos.</p>

<p>Guillen showed Martin the letter from the Infanta, and told
him that he would go to Carrion before he returned to Burgos,
with the intention of removing Teresa from the castle.</p>

<p>"I will accompany you, Guillen," said the Vengador, "and
I will die with you if necessary."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Martin," exclaimed Guillen, holding out his hand
affectionately to his friend; "but I know the danger which
threatens both you and me when we approach Carrion; I
cannot therefore accept your generous offer, for&mdash;what
would become of your good and loving Beatrice if she were
to lose you?"</p>

<p>"Beatrice," replied Martin, "would look on me as a coward,
and would despise me, with very good cause, if I saw you
going into danger without accompanying you. Do I not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
value more than my life the friendship with which you honour
me, and the good fortune which you procured me, when you
induced me to exchange the vile career of a bandit for that of
a soldier? Guillen, let us set out for Carrion as soon as it
may please you, for I will follow you gladly to the end of the
world, even though there were dangers at every step. I wish
that Rui-Venablos could accompany us, but he must remain
in command of the Cid's troops during our absence."</p>

<p>Guillen finally accepted the offer of Martin. They spent
the remainder of the day and the following night in the farmhouse
of Pero, and at a very early hour in the morning they
started for Carrion.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">FROM VIVAR TO CARRION</p></blockquote>


<p>At the fall of the evening Guillen and Martin arrived within
view of the castle, although they were still at a considerable
distance from it; they determined to await the night in a
thick grove of chestnut trees, in order that they might
continue their journey as soon as it grew dark, and arrive at
the castle by midnight, as had been arranged between Guillen
and Gonzalo.</p>

<p>The sun was near setting, and was lighting up, with a fiery
glow, the distant horizon. Guillen and Martin had dismounted,
and, whilst their horses were grazing amongst the
chestnut trees, were seated on a high bank, from which they
had an extensive view of the surrounding country. Martin
had his eyes fixed on the wide and fertile plain of Carrion,
the beauty of which confirmed what he had said on the
previous day&mdash;that the hand of God had been also extended
over Castile, when He was distributing the best gifts of nature.
Guillen was gazing on the Castle of Carrion, which arose in
the distance, veiled by the smoke arising from heaps of
burning stubble, like a dark phantom, which seemed intent
on filling with terror that calm and enchanting landscape.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, with a heavy heart, and with tears ready to
break from his eyes, "how near appears that accursed castle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
and, notwithstanding, what a distance separates me from her
who sighs within it! There&mdash;within those gloomy walls&mdash;is
the dear girl who has, in the whole world, no other hope but
my love. Would that I could fly like those birds, which, in
the branches of the trees surrounding us, are plaintively
singing their farewell to the day! Would that I could fly
like them through the clear air and alight on the sill of that
window, at which Teresa has so often shed sad tears. Perhaps
the poor girl is now standing, full of grief, at that window,
thinking of me, and beseeching the Virgin, whose sanctuary
is on the neighbouring hill, to guide my footsteps, and to make
me brave enough to endeavour to get to her."</p>

<p>Guillen and Martin suddenly abandoned their enthusiastic
reflections, for, turning round, they saw behind them about
fifty armed men, who came out from amongst the surrounding
trees. Both placed their hands on their swords, but before
they had time to draw them, those men rushed upon them,
with threatening aspect, and seized on them, crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you move hands or feet you are dead!"</p>

<p>Guillen doubted not but that these were the robbers of
whom Gonzalo had spoken.</p>

<p>"Cowards," he said to them, "you have not courage enough
to fight, arm to arm and breast to breast, although you are
twenty times as numerous as we are, but treacherously capture
us without giving us time to defend ourselves."</p>

<p>"By the glorious San Isidore!" cried out one of the bandits,
closely examining Martin, "I have less sense than these
horses if we have not amongst us our former captain, the
valiant Vengador."</p>

<p>"I am the Vengador," said Martin, examining in his turn
the bandits, who hastened to set both him and Guillen free,
with evident marks of respect.</p>

<p>"I certainly remember," he added, "having seen some of
you in my band."</p>

<p>"We are those who were in it," replied four of the bandits,
amongst whom was he who had first recognised Martin, and
who appeared to be the leader.</p>

<p>"Do you not remember," said this man, "Juan Centellos,
who on the day of the death of the Raposo proposed that
you should be chosen as the chief of those remaining of the
band, and who said to you that he had a daughter as good
as the noblest lady in Castile, and who afterwards cured the
wound which you had received on your head?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it well," replied Martin.</p>

<p>"Do you not also remember that after the unlucky attack on
the Castle of Carrion, some of the few of us that succeeded in
escaping, separated themselves from the band, hoping that, by
working separately, they would find it easier to avenge themselves
than by remaining with their companions?"</p>

<p>"I do; you were one of them."</p>

<p>"And the others were the three whom you see here. All
our efforts were, however, useless, and we therefore made up
our minds to rejoin the band. When we went to look for it,
we learned that it had marched to Portugal, and since then
we have wandered about the district of Carrion, sometimes
with good fortune, sometimes with bad. Do you know, Sir
Vengador, that Bellido Dolfos, whom you loved so much, was
the greatest traitor that woman ever give birth to?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have since learned that it was he who sold the
band in Carrion."</p>

<p>"That is what I was just about to tell you. And, by my
soul, Don Suero is pleased with him, for he keeps him in his
castle, treating him royally. Anger of Lucifer! if we only lay
hands on him, and we are trying to do so for a long time!
Don't go too near Carrion, for if that Bellido smells you it
will be bad for you, for you must know that he is not so much
your friend as you perchance think."</p>

<p>"It is to the Castle of Carrion that we are going, as Bellido
is now absent."</p>

<p>"The son of my mother would not trust much in his
absences. Do not go there, Sir Vengador; and I give the
same advice to this youth, although I do not know who he is....
But now that I look closely at him, I think that he is
the page who came with Doña Teresa to our camp."</p>

<p>"He is the same," replied Martin.</p>

<p>"What, does he no longer serve Don Suero?"</p>

<p>"Far from serving him, he would plunge his sword in him,
and also in Bellido, if he only had them in his power."</p>

<p>"I repeat to you, however, Sir Vengador, that you should
not go to the castle, for I fear that some evil will come on
you there."</p>

<p>"I thank you for the interest you take in us; but we are
resolved to enter the castle this very night, and we would not
abandon our intention for all the wealth of the world."</p>

<p>"Well, then, as you are resolved to go on, may God send
you good luck!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think," said Guillen, "that we cannot remain here longer,
as night is coming on, and we are still far from the castle."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Martin; and he added, turning to the
bandits&mdash;</p>

<p>"We wish you good luck; and if you don't object, we are
going to continue our journey."</p>

<p>"Continue it, with our good wishes," answered Juan
Centellos; "but tell me, Sir Vengador, what do you mean
by good luck?"</p>

<p>"By good luck I mean that you may escape from the
Salvadores, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And that Bellido and Don Suero may fall into our hands,
so that we may pay off last year's treachery; is it not so?"
interrupted the captain of the band.</p>

<p>"That is what I was about to say to you," answered Martin.</p>

<p>The two travellers then mounted and continued their
journey.</p>

<p>They had left the bandits a considerable time, when they
thought they heard the noise of people in their rear; they
stopped to listen, but as they heard nothing more they believed
that it was voices borne by the breeze from some village in
their vicinity; they then silently pursued their way.</p>

<p>They came at last near the wood situated close to the castle,
and recognised it by the branches of the trees standing out
against the sky behind them. They dismounted there, enveloped
the hoofs of the horses with some pieces of cloth,
which they had brought with them for that purpose, and,
thanks to that precaution, they approached the postern of
the castle with scarcely any noise, leading their horses by the
bridles.</p>

<p>A white handkerchief, held out through one of the loopholes,
and which could be distinctly seen against the dark background
of the wall, was waved for a moment, as if summoning them
to that spot. They then fastened their horses to trees, and
proceeded to the postern, which Gonzalo immediately opened,
with the least noise possible.</p>

<p>"Ascend by the secret stairs," he said to Guillen, "and
come back soon; I shall await you here, to shut the postern
when you go out."</p>

<p>Guillen, who was well acquainted with the rooms and
corridors of the castle, mounted, feeling his way, the stairs
which Gonzalo had indicated to him, and Martin followed
close behind; both had their unsheathed swords in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
hands, in order to be prepared in case of a surprise. In a
short time they were in the upper storey of the castle, and
consequently near the apartments of the Infanta.</p>

<p>The heart of Guillen was beating with violence; against it
would soon rest, throbbing, the heart of Teresa, which for so
long a time had been sad and solitary.</p>

<p>Both youths reached the door of Teresa's apartment; at
that moment it suddenly opened; she rushed towards Guillen
with open arms, and fell senseless on his neck, crying out,
"Guillen, Guillen!"</p>

<p>And that exclamation was so loud that it echoed through
the vaulted passages of the castle.</p>

<p>"Treason, treason! The chamber of the Infanta!"
answered, to the cry of Teresa, a voice which Guillen and
Martin recognised with terror; it was the voice of Bellido,
who had pretended to have left the castle in order to surprise
Guillen, who, he doubted not, would be informed of his
absence by the Infanta, and would therefore hasten to visit
her.</p>

<p>A great din of footsteps, of voices, and of arms followed the
cry of Bellido.</p>

<p>The Infanta remained in a faint, notwithstanding the efforts
of Guillen and Martin to restore her to consciousness.</p>

<p>"Let us fly from the castle," said Martin. "Take the Infanta
in your arms, and I will protect you behind; we shall thus
escape, for if Gonzalo did not betray us, the postern is still
open."</p>

<p>Guillen took up Teresa in his arms; her weight could not
embarrass him much, for the unhappy girl was worn away with
grief; then, followed by Martin, he ran to the staircase by
which they had ascended. Just as they placed their feet on
the first step they were overtaken by Bellido and a number of
servants and crossbow-men, who attacked them furiously; the
staircase, however, was narrow, and that circumstance favoured
Martin, who had only to ward off three or four blows at a time.
At last they reached the postern, which Gonzalo quickly
opened. He placed himself at the side of Martin, determined
to share the fate of the young men, fighting against Bellido
and his followers: all the combatants were then outside the
castle.</p>

<p>At that moment loud voices were heard amongst the neighbouring
trees, and a number of men rushed like lions on
Bellido's followers, whilst others entered the postern, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
obedience to Juan Centellos, who cried out, "Come on, my
brave fellows; let some get into the castle, and let the others
exterminate those cowards, who are attacking the Vengador!"</p>

<p>The forces were now more equal; or rather, those who were
at first the weaker had become the stronger. The combat was
obstinate and bloody, both without and within the castle.
Inside, the advantage should be on the side of the bandits, for
their opponents were but few, as almost all the men-at-arms, who
guarded the castle, had sallied forth in pursuit of the abductors.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the castle was a convent of nuns,
to which Guillen made his way, with his precious burden,
hearing behind him the noise of the combat.</p>

<p>What a torture was it for the brave youth to hear, at but a
few paces from him, the clashing of swords, and not be able
to use his! He ran&mdash;flew on, as if nothing were impeding his
footsteps; and if the question were then asked, What most
urged him on with such speed to the convent? whether it was
to place Teresa in a place of safety, or to return to fight amid
his friends? it would have been difficult to answer.</p>

<p>Suddenly the town and its vicinity was lighted up with a
bright glare. The Castle of Carrion had been set on fire.</p>

<p>Guillen arrived at the door of the convent, which was a
small building, recently erected to shelter the community
which occupied it, until Christian charity would enable them
to build another, larger and more beautiful. He pulled
violently a rope, which hung outside the door, and set a bell
ringing. Some of the nuns ran to this summons, and Guillen
hurriedly said to them&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fire is consuming the castle of the Counts of Carrion;
afford hospitality to the Infanta Doña Teresa, whom I have
had the good fortune to rescue from the flames."</p>

<p>The nuns hastened to afford assistance to the young lady,
and Guillen left the convent, making his way to the castle, in
the vicinity of which the fight was still raging. After proceeding
a short distance, he met Martin and Gonzalo, and the
three embraced warmly.</p>

<p>"Martin," cried Guillen, "the innocent dove is now free,
and saved from the talons of the hawk."</p>

<p>"And the hawk," replied the Vengador, "is in flight, pursued
by Juan Centellos and others of our aiders, and the riches
of Don Suero are in the power of the bandits."</p>

<p>"To Vivar, to Vivar!" cried Guillen. "God has commenced
to discharge the bolts of His justice on the heads of the wicked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
and expiation will be completed in the end. Gonzalo," he added,
turning towards him who had facilitated his entrance into the
castle, "come with us, and you will be with your best friends."</p>

<p>They then proceeded to the place where they had left the
horses, which were still fastened to the trunks of the trees.</p>

<p>"My horse is strong," said Guillen to Gonzalo, "get up
behind me and you shall see that this horrible spectacle will
be soon lost to our view. It is a sight which oppresses and
saddens my soul. My God! my God! the fire consumes the
apartment of Teresa, which I should like to see preserved, as
the sanctuary of my sweetest remembrances. See how the
flames burst from the window, at which the Infanta so often
stood, sad and broken-hearted! Comrades, let us get away as
quickly as possible."</p>

<p>The three of them then made their way towards the Burgos
road, whilst the flames, fanned by a strong breeze, roared
through the castle, shooting up to the very battlements, and
illuminating with their sinister glare the plain of Carrion to a
considerable distance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">HOW A GOOD CAVALIER WAS CHARGED WITH AN EVIL MESSAGE</p></blockquote>


<p>It must be confessed that ambition was the ruling passion of
Don Sancho; it must also be admitted that the injustice, or
rather the imprudence, of his brothers, supplied food to that
passion. Don Sancho was haughty and irritable in a high
degree, and that character of his contributed also, not a little,
to cause him to forget that, in extending his dominions, those
whom he attacked were his brothers, and that, whether just or
unjust, the wishes of a dying father should be held sacred.</p>

<p>Guillen did not deceive himself when he said that, in a short
time, there would be a sanguinary war between Leonese and
Castilians. The counts sent into exile by Don Sancho,
amongst whom we must include the Count of Cabra, who, not
content with the district which the Cid had so generously
recovered for him, was working, in union with his friends, to
avenge his banishment,&mdash;those counts, we repeat, worked on
the mind of Don Alfonso in the same manner as they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
influenced that of Doña Elvira, so that Leon might provoke
Castile to a war, in which Don Sancho might lose his crown,
and perhaps his life. It might be that Don Alfonso himself
would lose both; in that case, however, the Count of Carrion
and his friends would lose but little, for the worst that could
then happen to them would be that they should complete
their exile in states held by the Moors, in Aragon or Navarre,
instead of in the kingdom of Leon. In that game they might
win, but they could not lose.</p>

<p>Don Alfonso knew of the ambitious aims of his brother, and
doubted not but that he would very soon declare war against
him, in order to dispossess him of his kingdom, whether he
were provoked to it or not; he therefore hastened to put himself
in a state of defence, so that he might not be unprepared,
should his fears be realised.</p>

<p>Don Sancho, knowing of the warlike preparations of his
brother, demanded explanations from him regarding their
object. The answer of Don Alfonso by no means satisfied
him; negotiations succeeded, becoming gradually more embittered,
and in the end there was a complete rupture between
Castile and Leon; the efforts of the Cid and some other
honoured noblemen to prevent it having had no result.</p>

<p>Don Alfonso asked for aid from the kings of Navarre and
of Aragon; but before they were able to afford it, Don Sancho
had collected together a good army and hastened to invade
the territory of his brother. The two contending parties came
to blows near a village named Plantaca; they fought with
great valour, and victory declared for the Castilians. The
king, Don Alfonso, being conquered, and his army destroyed,
was forced to retire to the city of Leon, where he intended to
reinforce himself, with the object of again attacking his
victorious enemies.</p>

<p>He encountered them again near Golpelara, on the banks
of the river Carrion; another battle was fought, and, fortune
changing, the Castilians were beaten, before the Cid was able
to take part in the combat.</p>

<p>Rodrigo Diaz was very unwilling to fight against any of the
children of Don Fernando, and he only decided to do so when
he saw Don Sancho, whom he had accompanied in this war,
quite powerless. On his arrival at the field of battle, he found
the Castilian army cut up and in flight, and Don Sancho in
despair. He cheered him up, assuring him that he would
regain all he had lost, got together again the flying soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
and before daybreak attacked the Leonese, who, heavy with
sleep and wine, as Mariana writes, were far from thinking of
such a thing. The most terrible disorder arose in the army of
Don Alfonso. Some fled, others took up their arms in a careless
way, all were commanding, no one obeying; they were
vanquished, therefore, in a very short time. Don Alfonso,
fearing that he would soon fall into the hands of his enemies,
fled from the field of battle and shut himself up, with some of
his followers, in the church of Carrion; the Castilians, however,
surrounded it, and compelled him to surrender.</p>

<p>Don Sancho sent him at once to Burgos, and followed up
the conquest of the kingdom of Leon. The city of that name
and other towns resisted; in the end, however, they yielded,
and in a few days the entire kingdom of Don Alfonso was in
the hands of Don Sancho.</p>

<p>Many noble Castilians and Leonese, amongst whom were
Doña Urraca, Peranzures, and the Cid, interceded with Don
Sancho, praying him to make the condition of the prisoner as
favourable as possible. The King of Castile consented to his
brother going to the monastery of Sahagun, taking the habit of
a monk, and renouncing the secular state.</p>

<p>Don Alfonso did not remain long in that monastery.
Whether it was that the monastic life disgusted him, that he
suspected the intentions of his brother, or that he desired to
put himself in a position to recover the kingdom he had lost,
whenever a favourable opportunity might present itself,&mdash;whatever
was the true reason, he fled to Toledo, where he was
kindly received by Almenon, who was glad to find an opportunity
for fulfilling the promise which he had made to the dead
king, Don Fernando, of affording the same protection to his
children which he had afforded to his daughter Casilda. He
told him that he might remain in his states as long as he
desired; that he would provide for all his wants in such a
manner that he would scarcely regret the throne which he had
lost; and that he would treat him as a son. Don Alfonso
entered into a covenant with Almenon to serve him in the
wars in which he was engaged with other neighbouring Moors.
He was accompanied by Peranzures and other cavaliers, to
whom the King of Toledo made allowances, by means of
which they could maintain themselves, and his ordinary
occupation was the chase. For greater convenience in the
pursuit of this, he built a country-house, which was the origin
of the town of Brihuega.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>There now only remained to Don Sancho to take possession
of Zamora, in order to possess all the states which had
belonged to his father. The city of Zamora was well supplied
with fortifications, munitions, provisions, and soldiers, which
were there in order that all emergencies might be provided for.
The inhabitants were very brave and loyal, and were always
ready to expose themselves to any dangers by which they
might be threatened. They were under the command of
Arias Gonzalo, a cavalier advanced in years, of great valour
and prudence, and whose counsels, in matters of government
and war, were much esteemed by Doña Urraca.</p>

<p>Don Sancho desired to possess that city, especially as he
now held Toro, which he had taken from Doña Elvira, and, as
the two were near each other, he feared that the people of
Zamora, who were strong and daring, might fall upon the
latter; he, however, desired to live in peace with Doña
Urraca, for whom he had always felt a greater affection than
for his other brothers and sisters. Hoping that he might be
able to obtain Zamora in exchange for some other place, and
not by force of arms, he resolved to send the Cid in order to
negotiate such an exchange with the Infanta.</p>

<p>"Zamora is worth half a kingdom," he said to Rodrigo;
"built on a rock, its walls and citadels are very strong, and
the Duero, which runs beneath it, serves it as an admirable
defence. If my sister would deliver it up to me, I would hold
it in more esteem than the entire kingdom of Leon. I pray
you, therefore, good Cid, to go to Doña Urraca, and ask her
to give it to me in exchange, or else for a monetary consideration.
Tell her that for Zamora I will give her Medina de
Rioseco, Villalpando, with all its lands, the Castle of Tiedra,
or Valladolid, which is a very rich city, and I, together with
twelve of my vassals, will make oath to faithfully keep my
promise to her."</p>

<p>"Sire," replied Rodrigo, "you have always found me, and
shall always find me, prepared to obey you, for in no other
manner could I repay all the favours you have bestowed on me,
or fulfil the promise which I made your father when he was on
his deathbed; but if I go to Zamora with the message which
you desire to confide to me, your sister will believe, the
inhabitants of Zamora, and even the Castilians and Leonese
will believe, that I am aiding you in depriving Doña Urraca of
her inheritance, and that I am breaking the promise which I
made to your father. I beseech you, sire, to use the services,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
in this special matter, of other cavaliers, who have not the
same motives as I have to keep entirely out of the matter."</p>

<p>"I do not send you," replied Don Sancho, "to threaten my
sister, but to make amicable proposals to her. What Castilian
cavalier is as respected as you by the inhabitants of Zamora, or
whose words would have so much influence as yours on Doña
Urraca? Or do you fear that the promises which you might
make in my name would not be kept by me?"</p>

<p>"You insult me, sire, by imagining that Rodrigo Diaz could
have any doubt regarding the promises of his king."</p>

<p>"Then go to Zamora and endeavour to induce my sister to
yield up her inheritance to me; I beseech you to do so, as a
friend, and I command you to do so, as your king."</p>

<p>On the same day the Cid set out for Zamora, where, for
some time, ambassadors were expected from Don Sancho to
demand the submission of the city. When the Cid came near
it the Infanta was in her palace, listening to the counsels of
Arias Gonzalo and other noblemen.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Zamora, when they saw from the walls
Rodrigo Diaz and his retinue, who were proceeding towards
the ancient gate in order to enter the city, they began to utter
loud cries and lamentations, seeing that the time had come
which they had so long dreaded; and the guards at the gate
prepared to resist the entrance of the Castilians. Doña
Urraca heard the loud cries and the alarm, which had now
extended through the entire city, and when she inquired, and
was informed of the cause, she went to a window which
overlooked the exterior of the gate, although the nobles who
were with her tried to prevent her, fearing that some weapon
might be cast at her from the outside. It was then that,
seeing the Cid at the foot of the wall of the city, she addressed
to him those bitter reproaches, which have been preserved,
thanks, perhaps, to the metrical form which, at a later period,
was given to them&mdash;</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"Leave me, leave me, Don Rodrigo,<br />
Haughty Castilian cavalier!<br />
Well should you remember<br />
The good times that are past;<br />
When a knight you first were made<br />
Before St James's holy altar;<br />
My father gave to you your arms;<br />
My mother gave to you your steed;<br />
I buckled on the spur of gold;<br />
That more honoured you might be,"<br />
</p>

</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodrigo raised his face on hearing that reproof, which he
was so far from deserving, and felt his heart wounded, not so
much because those words accused him of being disloyal and
ungrateful, but on account of the grief which Doña Urraca
showed by still wearing mourning, both for the death of her
father, and for the death of the happiness which had reigned
for so many years in her family. The face of the Infanta was
pale and haggard, and from her eyes flowed abundant tears.</p>

<p>"My lady," replied Rodrigo, "calm yourself, and admit me
to your presence, for I do not come as an enemy; Rodrigo
Diaz de Vivar will never bear arms against the daughter of
Don Fernando the Great."</p>

<p>Doña Urraca became calm on hearing those words, and
gave orders that the Cid should be permitted to enter the city.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the honoured Castilian was in the
presence of the Infanta. He kissed her hand, bending his
knee respectfully before her, and repeated to her the message
which Don Sancho had entrusted to him. Doña Urraca then
broke out afresh into lamentations.</p>

<p>"Woe is me!" she exclaimed; "what is this which Don
Sancho demands of me? How badly has he fulfilled the
wishes of our father!&mdash;of our father, who called down the
wrath of Heaven on the brother who would attack his brother.
Our father was scarcely dead, when Don Sancho took all his
territories from my brother, Don Garcia, and made him a
prisoner; then he deprived Don Alfonso of his kingdom, who,
finding himself so badly treated by Christians, had to take
refuge amongst the Moors. He took Toro from my sister, and
now he desires to take Zamora from me. Don Sancho knows
that his brothers and sisters are not strong enough to fight
against him face to face; but where the sword of the loyal is
not able to do its office, the dagger of traitors can work; if
Don Garcia is a prisoner, Don Alfonso, on the other hand, is
free and is in the country of the Moors."</p>

<p>Doña Urraca was weeping inconsolably whilst thus speaking;
and neither the words of Rodrigo nor those of the other
cavaliers were able to tranquillise her.</p>

<p>"Dry up your tears, my lady," said old Arias Gonzalo, whose
words were those which had the most authority with the Infanta;
"it is not with tears that troubles are remedied. Consult your
vassals; inform them of that which Don Sancho pretends to,
and if they think it well, deliver to the king the territory of
Zamora; but if they consider that you should not do so, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
shall all defend it for you, as brave and honourable men. Don
Sancho asks you to give him Zamora, promising to hand over
to you other places in exchange for it; but how can you trust
him to keep his promise, who has so badly carried out the will
of his father? For my part, I advise you not to deliver up the
city to your brother. We shall die in it, rather than surrender
it in a cowardly manner, and I believe that all its inhabitants
will be of my opinion. Do you wish to know at once, my lady?
Do you wish to learn now, whether the people of Zamora are
resolved to defend your inheritance or not? Crowds swarm
at the gates of this Alcazar in order to learn what resolution
you may come to. Let me ask your people whether they
prefer to bring on them the anger of Don Sancho, or to see
their mistress despoiled of that which rightly belongs to her."</p>

<p>When he had thus spoken, Arias Gonzalo went to a window
which overlooked a small square which lay at the front of the
Alcazar. Crowds were indeed swarming into it, anxious to learn
what the message was which the Cid had brought, for no one
doubted but that it was a very important one for the people of
Zamora, when that famous cavalier had been entrusted with it.</p>

<p>"People of Zamora!" cried out old Arias Gonzalo, whose first
words imposed a hushed silence on the assembled multitude.
"The king, Don Sancho, wishes to take from our lady, Doña
Urraca, the city of Zamora in exchange for other places which
he promises to give her. Do you desire that the Infanta should
yield to those demands of her brother, or are you prepared
to fight, as brave men, in the defence of her inheritance?"</p>

<p>"We will die fighting within the walls of Zamora!" was the
universal shout which answered Arias.</p>

<p>"Zamora for Doña Urraca! Zamora for Doña Urraca!"
the multitude continued to cry; and then the old man turned
to the Infanta and said to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now you hear, my lady, the opinion of your vassals."</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied Doña Urraca, assuming a masculine
haughtiness, "good Cid, say to Don Sancho that his sister and
all her vassals will die in Zamora, rather than yield it up to him."</p>

<p>"I shall bring that answer to the king, my lady," said the
Cid; "permit me to kiss your hand once more, as a pledge
that I shall fulfil my promise not to bear arms against you."</p>

<p>"I know already, Don Rodrigo, that you are an honourable
cavalier," replied the Infanta, holding out her hand that he
might kiss it. "Tell him that it sullies the reputation of the
strong to attack the weak; tell him that he should remember the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
affection I always had for him; tell him that, however great his
ambition may be, he should be satisfied with the states which
he already possesses; tell him that the malediction of his father
will fall on him; and tell him, finally, that I am his sister."</p>

<p>Rodrigo went forth from the Alcazar of Doña Urraca,
followed by the Castilian cavaliers who had accompanied him.
The people who still crowded the square, raging with fury
against Don Sancho, became silent when they saw him, and
respectfully opened a passage for him. Such was the esteem
in which that brave cavalier was universally held.</p>

<p>Whilst going through the crowds he saw cavaliers and
peasants, young men and old men, people indeed of all ranks
and conditions, and he thought he saw amongst them the
Count of Carrion and some others of the nobles who had been
banished by Don Sancho.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Castilians had left the city, they turned their
looks towards it, and saw the walls crowded with men, preparing
for the defence; they heard the sounds of the implements
which they were employing to repair the fortifications.</p>

<p>"Alas!" then exclaimed Rodrigo, "how much Christian
blood must flow by reason of the ambition of Don Sancho and
the wickedness of those who have stirred up those discords!"</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">THE SIEGE OF ZAMORA</p></blockquote>


<p>Rodrigo returned, sad and downcast, to give the answer of
Doña Urraca to Don Sancho, for he knew that ambition and
anger had more effect on him than the voice of relationship
and reason. The king was awaiting him impatiently, for he did
not wish to delay the addition of Zamora to his dominions,
either by arrangement or by force of arms. As soon, therefore,
as Rodrigo appeared in his presence, he hastened to ask him
what the reply of his sister was.</p>

<p>"Sire," answered the Cid, "the Infanta fears that, once
having taken from her the city of Zamora, you would not give
up to her the places which you offer in exchange for it."</p>

<p>"As God lives," interrupted Don Sancho in a rage, "I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
been very foolish to make peaceful proposals to one who has
so little faith in my promises! But does my sister consent to
yield up her territory to me?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, she is resolved to defend it at all costs,
for such is the love that her vassals have for her, that I myself
have heard them swear that they would defend the inheritance
of Doña Urraca, even were they all to die with their arms in
their hands."</p>

<p>"Then they shall die, and Zamora shall be mine."</p>

<p>"Sire, give ears to reason; consider that you are about to
fight against a weak woman, and, above all, that she is your
sister."</p>

<p>"She, who rejects the peace which I offer her, is not such;
she is not my sister who insults me by doubting my promises,
who denies the justice which urges me on to recover the
states which have been usurped from me, taking advantage
of the wishes of a dying man, whose reason at the time was
clouded by the near approach of death."</p>

<p>"Zamora is so strong, both in its walls and its defenders,
that, before you can take it, Christian blood will swell the
current of the Duero. Leave, sire, that paltry speck of earth
with your sister, and increase your kingdom by other conquests,
richer and more glorious: you are brave, and have
good soldiers, go to the lands of the Moors and fight there;
you can thus enlarge your dominions and gain honour, the
worth of which no one can ever place in doubt."</p>

<p>"Rodrigo!" exclaimed Don Sancho, irritated, "you plead
the cause of my sister with such warmth, that one might well
imagine that you were one of her partisans."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sire, if I depart somewhat from the respect
which a vassal owes to his king; but it is my duty to tell you
that all good cavaliers are bound to defend the weak, and I
only comply with the demands of chivalry by pleading the
cause of your sister."</p>

<p>"I wish to spare you the annoyance of being present at the
humiliation of Doña Urraca, by causing you to absent yourself
from Castile. Leave my kingdom, banished from it, within
nine days; for, if up to the present you have been a good
vassal, you are such no longer, since you oppose the wishes
of your king, instead of assisting him to augment his states."</p>

<p>"It is my duty to obey your orders," replied the Cid, with
humility.</p>

<p>And on the same day he set out from the Court, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
go into exile, followed by several cavaliers, who voluntarily
went to share his disgrace. The lamentations of the Castilian
people accompanied him everywhere, and all showed by their
demeanour, and by their words, the indignation with which the
conduct of Don Sancho filled them.</p>

<p>It was not long before he repented of his ingratitude; his
conscience and the words of the nobles who were present at
the Court made him see at once how unjust he had been
towards the Cid, and what evils the banishment of such a
good cavalier might bring upon Castile.</p>

<p>"Go," he said to Diego Ordoñez de Lara, "overtake De
Vivar, and pray him, in my name, to return; tell him that I
revoke the sentence of banishment, and that my greatest
happiness will be to see him return to my side, free from all
resentment."</p>

<p>Diego Ordoñez de Lara hastened to obey the king, and at
two o'clock in the afternoon he overtook the Cid, to whom
he delivered the message which the king had entrusted to
him.</p>

<p>Rodrigo returned with the messenger; and the king, instead
of giving him his hand to kiss, opened his arms to him, with
all the marks of affection, and besought him to forget his
unjust severity.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, could induce Don Sancho to abandon
his determination of taking possession of Zamora, although
many cavaliers, amongst whom De Lara was one of the most
prominent, joined their requests and prayers to those of the
Cid, that the Infanta might be left in peaceful possession of
her city. Don Sancho enrolled a good army and all the warlike
instruments necessary for the siege of a strongly fortified
place, and set out for Zamora, accompanied by the Cid, who,
however, was resolved not to break his promise or unsheath
his sword against Doña Urraca.</p>

<p>Having arrived before Zamora, he again demanded its
surrender by the Infanta; but the inhabitants, crowding on its
walls, replied with loud cries and threats, that they were
resolved to die rather than yield it up, and Doña Urraca
answered to the same effect. Don Sancho then hastened to
commence the siege, which, from the first day, was prosecuted
with great ardour. It was not much to the taste of the
soldiers of Don Sancho to be obliged to attack the inhabitants
of Zamora, but the cries and insults such as usually are
exchanged between besieged and besiegers made the Castilians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
forget the bad cause for which they were fighting, and they
soon regarded the people of Zamora as enemies and nothing
more.</p>

<p>The siege of Zamora was now definitely commenced.</p>

<p>The Castilians made an attempt to take the walls by assault;
they were, however, repulsed with heroic valour, and the
defenders of the city were filled with renewed confidence by
this first triumph. The assaults were frequently repeated, and
always with unhappy results for the besiegers, which intensified
more and more their anger, and especially that of Don Sancho,
who had not expected such a stubborn resistance from the
weak woman who had opposed his ambitious plans.</p>

<p>The tent of Don Sancho was pitched on a hill, a few
hundred paces distant from the city, opposite one of the large
gates which afforded entrance into it. From it Zamora could
be plainly seen, the walls and turrets of which were always
crowded with men who defied those outside with shouts and
waving of their arms. The Castilians attacked the walls three
times during one night, and Don Sancho was at their front,
in the most dangerous positions: all these attacks were,
however, unavailing, for the walls were almost impregnable,
both on account of their solidity and height, and of the great
bravery of the people of Zamora. At sunrise on the day
following that sanguinary night, Don Sancho was standing
before his tent, gazing on the haughty city and thinking out
new plans by which to take it. His cavaliers, heavy with
sleep and fatigue, were lying in all directions throughout the
camp; but he, Don Sancho the Strong, had not taken any
repose, for the energy of his soul was superior to all physical
weaknesses. His eyes remained constantly fixed on the proud
city, which he would have wished to reduce to ruins by his
glances. In his mind no project was so impossible that it
could not be carried out, but the taking of Zamora now
appeared to him, if not impossible, at least very difficult, as
the flower of his warriors had perished at the foot of those
walls, and in proportion as his soldiers became discouraged,
the confidence of his opponents had increased. The proud
monarch was thinking of the shame which would come upon
him on the day when he should have to abandon the siege,
and all the world would know that he had not been able to
conquer a woman; at that moment he would have accepted
death itself, if it were only accompanied by the surrender of
Zamora.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>When he was deeply immersed in those reflections, he heard
loud sounds of voices in the direction of the city, and he saw,
coming through the gate, which was opposite his camp, a
number of cavaliers behind a man, who was advancing about
forty paces in front of them. Don Sancho believed that the
soldiers of Zamora were making a sortie for the purpose of
attacking the camp, and the sentries thought the same. They
began to spread the alarm amongst the Castilians, when they
ceased suddenly, on seeing that only he who was in advance
of the cavaliers came towards them, and that the others returned
into the city through the postern by which they had issued
from it.</p>

<p>"King Don Sancho!" a voice called out from the walls,
just at the moment that this man was approaching the camp
of the besiegers,&mdash;"King Don Sancho, beware of Bellido Dolfos,
for he is going to your camp, plotting some treachery against
you. If he deceives you, do not blame us, for Arias Gonzalo
and all the honourable men of Zamora warn you."</p>

<p>Bellido heard that voice, and coming up, panting, he prostrated
himself at the feet of the king, exclaiming, "Sire, do
not believe those men of Zamora. Arias Gonzalo and his
followers calumniate me, for they fear that you may conquer the
city if you hearken to my words, for they know well that I
can point out a position to you from which you can take
Zamora."</p>

<p>Don Sancho held forth his hand to Bellido and raised him
up kindly, saying to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"I believe you, and I should be considered stupid and an
idiot if I were to trust in those who insult me and oppose my
authority, instead of in him who comes to my camp to receive
orders at my feet."</p>

<p>"Thanks, sire!" exclaimed Bellido. "Zamora shall be yours
within two days if you let yourself be guided by my counsels,
for not far from here there is a gate, through which you can
enter it; but I fear that, having heard the accusation of
treachery, which Arias has directed against me, you will distrust
me, and that my desire to serve you shall be in vain."</p>

<p>"No, it shall not be in vain, Bellido; I do not distrust you,
and if you wish that I should prove that to you, tell me where
I must assault the walls, and you will see that, this very day,
I shall fight there in front of my troops."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my lord, come with me, and just beyond that
rampart, which you see, to our right, I will show you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
Cambron Gate, through which you will be able to enter
Zamora, provided you do not forget the instructions which I
will give you."</p>

<p>"Let us not lose time, my good Bellido, let us now proceed
to reconnoitre the gate of which you tell me, and this very day
we shall enter through it, and humble the insolent pride of the
defenders of Zamora."</p>

<p>Don Sancho mounted his horse, in a joyous state of mind,
and prepared to set out with Bellido. The cavaliers who
surrounded him, amongst whom were the Cid and Diego
Ordoñez de Lara, were preparing to go with the king, but
when Bellido noticed it he hastened to say to Don Sancho&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, it would much please me if you and I alone
went, in order not to attract too much the attention of those
in the town, for they would fortify at once the abandoned
gate if they surmised that we were going to make an attack on
them through it; but as you have just reasons for distrusting
me, it is but right you should bring your cavaliers as a guard."</p>

<p>"Bellido," said Don Sancho, somewhat vexed at seeing
that the deserter was not quite convinced that he trusted him,
"I repeat to you that I have the fullest confidence in you,
and I assure you of that on the word of a king and of a
cavalier."</p>

<p>Then, turning to those who were preparing to accompany
him, he added&mdash;</p>

<p>"Remain in the camp, for I do not need to be guarded."</p>

<p>"Sire," said the Cid, "we shall go with Bellido; either
remain in your tent, or permit us to accompany you."</p>

<p>Don Sancho, however, did not pay any attention to the
words of the Cid, but set out with Bellido, both of them proceeding
cautiously around the walls of the town, and doing
their utmost to conceal themselves amongst the trees, so as
not to be seen by the enemy.</p>

<p>In a short time they were at a considerable distance from
the royal camp, but not so far that the cavaliers, who had
remained in it, lost them entirely to view.</p>

<p>Don Sancho was mounted on a spirited horse, the impetuosity
of which he felt it rather difficult to keep in control; and
when Bellido informed him that they were near the Cambron
Gate, he advanced some paces, not being able to curb his
impatience to see that road which he believed was to lead him
to the goal which he so anxiously desired to reach. Bellido
took advantage of that opportunity in order to carry out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
hellish plot, for the purpose of which he had gone to the
Castilian camp; he took a javelin in his hand, and darting it
with all the force he could command, buried it in the breast
of the unfortunate king. Don Sancho uttered a cry of agony,
and seized the javelin, not so much to free himself from it as
to use it against the assassin, but his strength was insufficient,
as it was quickly leaving him, and it was only with very great
difficulty that he could keep himself on his horse.</p>

<p>"Quick, my cavaliers!" cried the king, struggling with death,
which was now stopping his breath; "pursue the traitor who
has wounded me!"</p>

<p>The Cid hastened to mount Babieca in order to pursue the
assassin, who was hurrying off to seek refuge in Zamora, whilst
Don Diego Ordoñez de Lara and other cavaliers quickly proceeded
to the spot where Don Sancho was lying. The Cid,
in the haste with which he had mounted, had forgotten to
buckle on his spurs, for which reason the horse could not be
got to gallop as fast as the enraged cavalier desired. Bellido
was rapidly nearing a postern, and although the Cid urged on
Babieca by striking his flanks with his heels and the butt-end
of his lance, he was not able to overtake in time the treacherous
regicide, who arrived at the postern and entered it without
any opposition. Rodrigo, blinded by anger, would have
rushed into the town after him, but the gate was shut in his
face, and the Cid exclaimed in despair&mdash;</p>

<p>"May God curse the knight who rides without spurs!"</p>

<p>Don Sancho had breathed his last just at that moment,
and the loud lamentations and cries of fury, which were
uttered by the Castilian cavaliers around him, rent the air, and
filled with fear and dismay the entire camp of the besiegers.</p>

<p>Diego Ordoñez de Lara left the dead body of the king,
weeping with grief and rage, and ascended a hill which
commanded the town and sloped down towards it.</p>

<p>"People of Zamora!" he cried from it, with a voice of
thunder, "you are all murderers and traitors, for you have
received into the city Bellido Dolfos, who has assassinated
Don Sancho, my good king and lord. Those are traitors who
protect traitors, and as such I, Diego Ordoñez de Lara, brand
you. As traitors and murderers I challenge you all, great and
humble, men and women, living and dead, born and to be
be born, the fish and the birds, the flocks and the waters, the
plants and the trees, everything, in fine, that is in Zamora, and
all shall be exterminated by our anger!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>Arias Gonzalo, who heard the challenge of De Lara,
answered from the wall&mdash;</p>

<p>"If the people of Zamora were capable of committing the
treacherous act of which you accuse them, De Lara, Arias
Gonzalo and his sons would serve Moors rather than fight for
Doña Urraca. Remember that we cautioned Don Sancho
that Bellido was going to the royal camp for some treacherous
purpose, and that caution frees us from any blame. But if
you persist in your challenge, I accept it; for if I myself am
too old to fight against you, I have sons, honourable and
valiant, who will take my place."</p>

<p>"That is what I desire," said De Lara. "On the field of
battle I shall prove that the people of Zamora are vile traitors
and assassins."</p>

<p>Arias Gonzalo turned to those who crowded the ramparts of
Zamora, and to those who filled the square which was opposite
the palace of the Infanta, and said to them&mdash;</p>

<p>"Men, great and small, nobles and commoners, if there are
any amongst you who have taken part in the treachery of
Bellido Dolfos, speak out at once, for it would be better to go
as an exile to Africa than to be vanquished on the field as a
traitor and murderer."</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried out all, "may there be no salvation for our
souls if we had any part in that act of treachery!"</p>

<p>"Hear, De Lara," cried Arias: "Zamora accepts the
challenge which you have given to it, and Arias Gonzalo and
his followers will fight against you."</p>

<p>On that same day many Castilians left the camp and set out
for Castile, with the dead body of Don Sancho, which they
brought to Oña, where it was interred.</p>

<p>On that same day the people of Zamora and the Castilians
arranged the date, the place, and the conditions of the duel,
for which the challenge had been given by De Lara.</p>

<p>On that day, also, active search was made in Zamora with the
object of finding Bellido Dolfos, and delivering him up to the
fury of the townspeople, who were enraged by his crime, even
though it had been committed on their enemy.</p>

<p>The assassin, however, had succeeded in scaling the wall,
which overhung the Duero, without being seen; and having
done so, he hastened away from the town.</p>

<p>And finally, on that day, the Count of Carrion and his
friends celebrated the death of Don Sancho by a banquet given
in the lodgings of Don Suero.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">IN WHICH IT IS PROVED THAT ONE CAN FIGHT WITHOUT
CONQUERING OR BEING CONQUERED</p></blockquote>


<p>Some days after the death of the king, Don Sancho, great
excitement could be noticed in Zamora and its neighbourhood.
The cause of it was that, on a plain beside the Duero, the
combat was about to take place which was pending between
the Castilians and the men of Zamora, or, as their champions,
between Diego Ordoñez de Lara on the one side, and Arias
Gonzalo and his sons on the other.</p>

<p>Doña Urraca was in her palace, bathed in tears, on account
of the death of her brother, on account of the accusation which
De Lara had hurled against the people of Zamora, and on
account of the risk which the sons of Arias ran, for she
esteemed them very much, as, although very young, they were
loyal and brave cavaliers. Just then Gonzalo appeared,
followed by his sons Pero, Diego, Fernando, and another,
whose name the Chronicles do not give.</p>

<p>The old man and the youths, throwing back their large
cloaks, appeared clad in coats of mail, and they all knelt down
at the feet of the Infanta, whose hand they kissed with marks
of the greatest devotion and respect.</p>

<p>"Noble Infanta," said old Arias, "you know already that
Don Diego Ordoñez de Lara, one of the best of the Castilian
cavaliers, has challenged Zamora, and I have accepted the
challenge in the name of your subjects. The lists are open,
the judges of the combat are appointed, and the hour for it
approaches. I would be the first to commence the fight if I
did not know that my age makes me feeble, and that De Lara
might be able to boast of the first triumph; my sons, however,
whom you see here, are young, and moreover, skilful and
brave combatants, and they will defend your honour and that
of your subjects as long as they have blood in their veins. If
all my sons should fall in the struggle, I shall then use, in the
defence of your outraged honour, the little strength which yet
remains in my arm."</p>

<p>Doña Urraca broke out into fresh tears on hearing old
Arias.</p>

<p>"Do not weep, my lady," he said to her, "for good cavaliers
are born to conquer or to die in the fight. My sons and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
will go to the lists if you grant us your consent; give us no
thanks for doing so, for it is the duty of good vassals to
sacrifice their lives and their property for their sovereign."</p>

<p>"Go then, noble old man, and you also, loyal and brave
youths; God will protect those who defend their honour, and
He will have compassion on me, for if I should lose you I
shall ever weep for you."</p>

<p>Arias Gonzalo and his sons left the palace of Doña Urraca
and proceeded to the place of combat, accompanied by the
prayers which all the inhabitants of Zamora offered to God,
that He might give His divine aid to such good cavaliers.</p>

<p>An enormous multitude was collected around the lists; but
there were not reflected on the faces of those present the
animation and the joy which we have seen on those of the
spectators of another combat, that between Rodrigo Diaz and
Martin Gonzalez the Aragonian. Both the people of Zamora
and the Castilians were filled with grief by the death of Don
Sancho, for if the late king was ambitious and unjust when he
let himself be led away by his haughty and irascible character,
he was, on the other hand, valiant and passionately fond of
difficult enterprises; such qualities constituted the chief merit
of men in that specially warlike age.</p>

<p>Around the enclosure had been erected platforms for the
ladies and the judges of the combat, and the latter already
occupied their places when Arias and his sons received permission
to defend her cause from Doña Urraca; the places
reserved for the ladies were, however, unoccupied. That
combat did not awaken female curiosity, on account of the
way their minds were affected by the disastrous death of the
brave King of Castile, and by the infamous accusation which
weighed upon the people of Zamora. At the same moment,
also, Arias, with his sons and Don Diego Ordoñez de Lara,
arrived in the lists; he was accompanied, as his second, by
Martin Antolinez, in the absence of the Cid, who had departed
from Zamora, going with the corpse of Don Sancho to Oña.
He was desirous of accompanying his king to his last dwelling-place,
and of fulfilling his promise not to take any part against
the inhabitants of Zamora. When the spectators saw those
honoured and brave cavaliers, they broke out either in lamentation
or in maledictions on the treacherous regicide, on account
of whose crime such esteemed combatants had to risk their
lives.</p>

<p>All the preliminaries having been arranged and the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
measured by those appointed for that purpose, Pero Arias
appeared at one end of the lists, and Diego Ordoñez de Lara
at the other. Both were mounted on fiery chargers, were clad
with shining armour, were girt with swords, and were provided
with good shields and strong lances.</p>

<p>The judges gave the signal to the heralds, and they sounded
their trumpets. On hearing the first blast, the champions
prepared for the charge, and scarcely did they hear the second
when they drove their spurs into the flanks of their horses,
which rushed forward as swift as lightning. The meeting of
the combatants was terrible; the lances, however, struck the
shields, and, glancing off them, left the champions uninjured.
They then made ready for the second charge, and starting
with even greater speed than in the first, the lance of De
Lara pierced the helmet of Pero Arias, who felt himself
seriously wounded in the head. The champion of Zamora
reeled on his saddle, but, holding on by the mane of his
horse, he had strength enough to deal a furious blow at his
enemy. The sight of Pero Arias was dimmed by the blood
which flowed over his face, and, for that reason, his lance only
wounded the horse of De Lara; the young man then fell to
the ground, breathing his last.</p>

<p>A cry of lamentation was heard on all sides, and many of
the spectators burst into weeping. Diego Ordoñez brandished
his lance in the air and cried with a voice of thunder&mdash;</p>

<p>"Woe to the people of Zamora! Arias Gonzalo, send out
another son, for the first is settled with!"</p>

<p>Diego, the second son of Arias, went into the lists when
the body of his brother was removed, and when De Lara had
mounted a fresh horse, instead of that which had been badly
wounded by the lance of Pero. The cuirass of Diego Arias
was strong, but the lance of Diego Ordoñez struck it with such
force, that it went through it, and came out, with its point so
abundantly covered with blood, that the shaft and pennon
were stained by it. Diego Arias, mortally wounded in the
breast, fell to the ground, like an inert mass, and fresh cries
of grief and fresh wailings accompanied the death of the
second champion of Zamora.</p>

<p>De Lara again brandished his bloodstained lance and cried
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Woe to the people of Zamora! Send out another son,
good Arias, for Diego's fighting days are over."</p>

<p>Fernando Arias was awaiting the blessing of his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
before proceeding to the lists, when the old man said to
him&mdash;</p>

<p>"My son, go fight for our honour, as a good cavalier should:
imitate your brothers and avenge their deaths, washing off at
the same time the stain of treachery, which De Lara has cast
upon us."</p>

<p>"Father," replied the young man, "do not insult me by
reminding me of my duty; I trust in God and in my arm
that Zamora and my brothers shall be avenged."</p>

<p>And Fernando Arias went out to the lists, anxious to pierce
with his lance Diego Ordoñez, who seemed to wish to devour
him with his furious glances.</p>

<p>The champions rushed on each other with a fury seldom
witnessed, and the lance of Fernando entered the shoulder
of Diego; he, however, far from losing courage on account of
the intense pain which the wound must have caused him,
hastened to charge again, and aiming at his adversary's head,
carried off his helmet, and wounded him, though but slightly.
Fernando, when he felt himself wounded, directed his lance
against De Lara, blind with rage and desperation; he, however,
only succeeded in wounding the horse.</p>

<p>The animal, feeling the blade of the lance of Fernando in
its neck, gave a great jump, which disconcerted its rider, then,
darting off, Diego not being able to control it, jumped over
the barrier, trampling down the crowd which was outside.</p>

<p>The judges ordered the herald to give the signal that the
combat was suspended, for according to the laws regulating
the duel the cavalier who quitted the lists was considered
conquered.</p>

<p>Don Diego de Lara wished to resume the fight, for he said
that his horse had crossed the barrier, he not having been
able to control it; but the judges did not permit it, and began
to argue over that unforeseen occurrence, without being able
to come to any decision.</p>

<p>Whilst the judges were deliberating, Arias Gonzalo said to
De Lara, not having sufficient mastery over himself to repress
his anger and the grief which he experienced on account of
the loss of his two sons&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are more arrogant than courageous, De Lara. You
have conquered beardless youths; but I maintain that you
could not overcome men, such as I formerly was."</p>

<p>De Lara replied, without becoming irritated&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good Arias, I could well recount to you acts of valour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
which would contradict your words; but to prove my prowess
it needs only to say that I have fought with your sons and
have vanquished them."</p>

<p>The old man recognised the fact that grief had made him
discourteous, and he could not but appreciate the moderation
of the Castilian who paid back insults with flattery. He was
about to hold out his hand to De Lara, but he restrained himself
when he saw that the judges were about to announce their
decision. This is how the heralds made it public:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The judges of the combat declare that both the champions
of Castile and of Zamora have acted as good and true men in
this contest, for if the Castilian champion quitted the lists, it
was not of his own election, but through the fault of his horse.
Both sides should consider themselves victors&mdash;the Castilians
satisfied, and Zamora freed from the charge of treachery which
was imputed to it."</p>

<p>This decision changed the lamentations and the consternation
of the crowds of spectators into joyous cheers; and Arias
Gonzalo extended his hand to De Lara, and said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have taken from me two sons, give me your friendship
in exchange for them, as I consider it as valuable as the
short tenure of life which remains to me."</p>

<p>"My friendship and my arms I give to you, honoured
Arias," replied Don Diego, pressing the old man to his
breast.</p>

<p>Some hours after the Castilians raised the siege of Zamora,
and Doña Urraca, by the advice of Arias and other nobles of
the city, wrote to Don Alfonso, shedding at the same time
copious tears, to inform him of the death of his brother, and
to advise him to take immediate steps to place his father's
crown upon his head, before ambitions could break loose, and
rival factions inundate the country with blood.</p>

<p>Eight days afterwards, Don Alfonso arrived in Leon, and
again took possession of the kingdom which his brother had
usurped from him; the kingdom of Galicia then spontaneously
placed itself under his sway, for no one desired the liberty of
Don Garcia, who was detested on account of his ungovernable,
tyrannical, and foolish character. He was then preparing to
set out for Burgos, to take possession of the kingdom of Castile,
but when this became known, the Castilian grandees
assembled together, at the earnest request of Rodrigo Diaz,
who thus addressed them:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have always considered Don Alfonso an honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
man, and Castile by right belongs to him; but as connivance
in the death of Don Sancho can be attributed to no one with
greater probability than to him, I am of opinion that the
Castilian people should demand an oath from him that he had
no part whatever in the treacherous crime of Bellido Dolfos.
Castile is held in the highest honour, and for that very reason
it has a right to know if he is an honourable man, whom it
proclaims its lord and king. It is necessary, then, that Don
Alfonso should swear that he had no part in the death of his
brother."</p>

<p>All the nobles approved of the views of the Cid, but all
trembled at the idea of the vexation which the demand of an
oath, that implied a highly offensive suspicion, would cause to
Don Alfonso.</p>

<p>"And who will dare to draw down upon himself the indignation
of Don Alfonso by exacting such an oath from him?"
many asked.</p>

<p>"I!" answered the Cid, with generous pride. "In addition
to being a subject of Don Alfonso, I am a Castilian and a
cavalier, and it is my duty to risk death, in order to preserve
immaculate the honour of my native land. I have always
looked upon Don Alfonso as an honourable and good man;
but I also know to what extent men are blinded by ambition
and the thirst for vengeance. I would venture to swear by all
that I love most in the world that it was the Count of Carrion,
with his partisans, whom I saw at the time at Zamora, that
spurred on Bellido to assassinate Don Sancho; but how can I
have complete confidence that they were not, beforehand,
instigated by Don Alfonso, especially when Doña Urraca
reminded me, before the commencement of the siege of
Zamora, that Don Alfonso was free, and that, if she was too
powerless to fight face to face with Don Sancho, daggers could
reach where swords could not avail? Let Don Alfonso come
to Castile; I shall exact the oath from him, and when he shall
have taken it, I shall be the first to kneel before him, in
acknowledgment of the vasalage which I owe him. The land
which was ruled over by the Count Fernan Gonzalez, and by
Don Fernando the Great, must only have as its king a man as
loyal and honourable as they were."</p>

<p>In a short time the resolve of the Cid had spread through
Burgos, and even through the entire of Castile, and this gained
for him, in the eyes of all the Castilians, a title to their love,
as great as that which he had ever gained by the most glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
of his triumphs on battlefields. On the same day on which
he had arranged with the nobles to demand the oath from
Don Alfonso, the brave and loyal cavalier was surrounded by
his family, delivering himself up to domestic happiness, which
for him was the sweetests of delights. Rodrigo was born in
an age when, in order to be a good son, a good husband, and
a good father, it was also necessary that a man should be a
good soldier; for the latter quality figured amongst the
greatest virtues. For that reason he passed the greater portion
of his life in the din of combats; but how can it be conceived
that a man could prefer the barbarous charms of war to the
sweetnesses of domestic peace, who always appears in history
with the names of his spouse and of his daughters on his lips,
weeping when separating from them, and loading with gifts
and affection those who protected his Ximena, his Sol, and
his Elvira? A Castilian artist, an enthusiastic admirer of the
Cid, the popular hero of Castile, has painted Rodrigo Diaz
in the following manner: the Cid has his left arm thrown
around the necks of Sol and Elvira, and his right arm around
that of Ximena; from his belt hangs his formidable sword,
and before them stands Babieca, ready caparisoned to set out
for the battlefield.</p>

<p>That picture is the complete history of the Cid Campeador.
It is as interesting as the one which Rodrigo Diaz and his
family presented on the day which we have mentioned. It
was a beautiful evening in spring: the background of the enchanting
picture was formed by the modest garden belonging
to the mansion, in Burgos, of the lords of Vivar. Rodrigo
was seated under a tree covered with foliage, and was caressing
a golden-haired child, that was jumping on his knees,
whose name also was Rodrigo, and was his first-born. By his
side were Ximena, Teresa Nuña, Lambra, and Mayor,
occupied with work suited to their sex; opposite was the
venerable Diego Lainez, who had been entertaining all of them,
for a considerable time, with a curious story of chivalry, connected
with one of his ancestors; and finally, was to be seen
Gil, the Moorish boy, adopted by Rodrigo in the mountains of
Oca, who was now approaching manhood, and was the idol of
the family, by reason of his discretion, his beauty, and the
generous instincts which he displayed.</p>

<p>"It is good," said Diego, "that the remembrance of deeds,
such as those which I have just related, should pass down
from father to son; that is why I have often recounted to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
those of Lain Calvo, who was my father. Would to God that
we had in Castile some that were capable of chronicling the
heroic deeds of those who wielded lance and sword, but in
that we are less fortunate than the Greeks and Romans."</p>

<p>"You are right," replied Rodrigo. "Oral tradition easily
distorts real facts, and it is a sad thing that the deeds of a
loyal and valiant age of chivalry should traverse the centuries,
confided to the folly of the ignorant crowd."</p>

<p>"Then it must not be the ignorant multitude that shall
perpetuate your brave deeds; if God permits me to become
a man!" exclaimed Gil, he who afterwards composed the
Chronicle of the famous cavalier, Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar.</p>

<p>"Rejoice, O Cesar, for you have already your Suetonius, to
write your history," said the old man, laughing, and all the
others joined with him.</p>

<p>"Good Gil," said Rodrigo, "wait until we return to Vivar,
and there I will teach you, if not how to write histories of
cavaliers, at least how cavaliers should act, so that their
memory may never die."</p>

<p>"And when shall we return to Vivar?" asked Ximena;
"when, Rodrigo, will you forget arms, in order to consecrate
yourself entirely to our love?"</p>

<p>"It appears to me that that day is not very distant,"
answered Rodrigo. "Don Alfonso is about to assume the
crown of Castile; Castile and Leon will then form but one
kingdom, and peace will be the result of the union of both
crowns. The day on which they hang up banners in Castile,
to honour Don Alfonso VI., will be that on which we shall
leave the Court and return to Vivar, where all of us will enjoy
the tranquillity which the anxieties of courts banish."</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">THE OATH IN SANTA GADEA</p></blockquote>


<p>There is unusual excitement in Burgos; very many persons
crowd in from the neighbouring villages on all sides of the
city, and streets and squares are thronged by the crowds, on
whose visages both fear and curiosity are expressed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
place, however, where the crush is greatest, is outside the
city, in the direction of the Leon road; many thousands of
people of all ages and conditions hasten thither, and direct
their looks, with avidity, towards a road which, at about
half-an-hour's walk from the city, becomes lost on the summit
of a hill, which limits the horizon. Whom do those people of
Burgos expect? Let us see if, amongst the crowds, we can
find any of our old acquaintances, who may be able to fully
satisfy our curiosity. Men and women, nobles, peasants, and
townspeople are everywhere, in the centre of the road, and on
the raised banks beside it, on the trees and on the adjacent
hills, all impatient, and all weary already of waiting; however,
we see no one that we know, not even the peasant from
Barbadillo, whose curiosity is as proverbial in Burgos as that
of his friend Iñigo, and whose conjugal affairs amuse so much
the townspeople, since the day they saw him disown his wife
at the door of the mansion of the lords of Vivar. But is not
that his wife,&mdash;the wife of Bartolo,&mdash;that handsome peasant
woman, who is walking with a young man on the summit of
the low hill? Yes, it is she. And is not Alvar the youth who
is in such good humour, and who is laughing with her? It is
Alvar, no doubt of that. She does not now seem disposed to
refuse, with blows, as she used to do at the smithy of Iñigo,
the flowers which the daring page presented to her.</p>

<p>"It is a long time now," said Alvar, "that I sigh for you and
bear the insults of your husband, and you have not rewarded
me even with a little embrace! Tyrant! Does a lover, as
faithful as I have been, merit such poor pay? Does my love,
perchance, displease you?"</p>

<p>"I only wish I were not a married woman, as you are such
a gentle youth, and not a fool like my husband; but, as long
as Bartolo lives, your efforts will be in vain, and those also of
the squire, Fernan, who makes love to me, as well as you."</p>

<p>"Accursed be my ill fortune!" said Alvar, stamping on the
ground. "It is on account of that Fernan, and not on
account of your husband, that you respond so badly to my
love."</p>

<p>"I respond to Fernan just the same as to you."</p>

<p>"So, you are pleased with his graces?"</p>

<p>"Why should not his please me as much as yours?"</p>

<p>"But don't mine please you? Reward me, if it is so."</p>

<p>"But those of Fernan merit an equal reward."</p>

<p>"Oh, how unfortunate I am with the women!" said Alvar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
despairing of ever seeing his love requited by the peasant
woman.</p>

<p>Whilst she and the page were thus conversing in a field
beside the road, Bartolo himself was struggling to make his
way through the crowd, looking anxiously in all directions, as
if he were seeking someone.</p>

<p>"Oh, Señor Bartolo, come here, as I have great news for
you!" cried out a man, who was resisting the rushing of the
waves, formed by the multitude, firmly planted against the
trunk of a tree. That man was the soldier who, on a former
occasion, had so courteously explained to him what was
going on between the servitors of the Cid; but Bartolo either
did not hear him, or paid no attention to his words.</p>

<p>"Señor peasant, come here, and I shall relate strange news
to you," persisted the soldier.</p>

<p>"I don't want your news," replied Bartolo at last. "I am
looking for my wife. The jade has escaped from my house,
and I swear that, if I catch her, she'll have to bear more wood
than a miller's ass"&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what I have to tell you is about your wife."</p>

<p>"About my wife? Where is the slut?"</p>

<p>"Look at her over there in the field, amusing herself with
one of her lovers."</p>

<p>"San Pedro de Cardeña, preserve me!" exclaimed the
peasant, looking in the direction which the soldier had pointed
out to him.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha! I stick to what I always said&mdash;that is, that
women are no great things," said the soldier, laughing
maliciously.</p>

<p>"I swear by all that's holy!" muttered the rustic, breaking
suddenly through the crowd in the direction of the hill. "My
wife was a simpleton in Barbadillo, but no person ever said a
word against her honour. A curse on this city and all the
news that can be got out of it! Since I came to Burgos I
have never had an easy day. Treacherous women! my wife
is a deceiver! I swear that, this very day, she shall return to
Barbadillo, with more blows than she has hairs on her head,
and neither she nor I shall ever leave the village again."</p>

<p>At last he arrived at the little hill, and making a short
circuit, in order to take at the rear his wife and the page, who
were still talking, to all appearance, very confidentially, he fell
suddenly on them, and with a stick, which he had provided
himself with, he began to belabour them furiously, his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
specially. Alvar only received one good stroke, for he
managed to escape through the crowd as soon as he felt the
peasant's stick on his back.</p>

<p>"I swear I'll kill you, traitress!" exclaimed Bartolo,
without ceasing to chastise his wife.</p>

<p>"Woe is me, woe is me! this brute of a husband will kill
me!" cried out the peasant woman. "Is there no one to
defend me against the savage?"</p>

<p>"You barbarian!" cried the surrounding people, "do not
maltreat a defenceless woman in such a way."</p>

<p>"I'll kill her, she is a jade!" replied Bartolo. And seizing
his wife by one arm, he went off, dragging her along and
exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"To Barbadillo, to Barbadillo! May Heaven's curse fall
on cities!"</p>

<p>This incident had amused the impatient crowd for a short
time; but, as soon as it terminated, all turned their gazes
again towards the hill on which the Leon road was lost to view.</p>

<p>"If Don Alfonso learned that no banners would be hung
out in his honour until he takes the oath," said one of the
bystanders, "he has certainly stopped on his way to raise men
to accompany him, and aid him in imposing his will on the
Castilians."</p>

<p>"What Don Alfonso has to do," replied another, "is to
swear, if he can do so with a good conscience; if not, he must
only rest content with the kingdom of Leon which he already
possesses, for honourable men will not be wanting to govern
Castile, as in the time of the Judges."</p>

<p>"There is one thing certain, and that is, if Don Alfonso
tries to put down Castile by force, he engages in a bad
business; and let him beware lest he have neither one
kingdom nor the other."</p>

<p>"God's anger! If the Cid raises his Green Standard and
cries, 'Castilians! we are honourable, and he who governs us
must also be honourable; we shall have no king suspected of
having shed his brother's blood. Rise with me to defend the
honour of our native land!' you will then see how all Castile
will spring up and seize on the kingdom of Leon, and Don
Alfonso will have to go and demand hospitality from the
Moors."</p>

<p>"I believe that he will not refuse to take the oath, for it is
impossible that he can have had any part in the death of Don
Sancho. Don Alfonso was always a good cavalier; he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
have wanted prudence, he may have lent his ears to evil
councillors, he may have been weak, but fratricide&mdash;I can't
believe that."</p>

<p>"What I believe, and what all believe, is that he will reject
the oath, not on account of his conscience, but through pride;
for, you see, the great always resent having conditions imposed
on them by their inferiors."</p>

<p>"And especially when those conditions imply so infamous
a suspicion as fratricide. But listen! What cries are those
which arise? Is Don Alfonso approaching already? It must
be, for all the people are crowding up on the hill."</p>

<p>Indeed, a body of men had been seen on the eminence
which bounded the horizon, and on seeing them, the multitude
became agitated, a prolonged murmur arose, and the people
who were scattered in all directions began to make their way
towards the main road. The strangers, who were in reality
Don Alfonso and about a hundred horsemen, who formed his
escort, were rapidly nearing Burgos. At last they came to the
place where the crowds were awaiting them, and which then
accompanied them, moving on at both sides of the road.
They were about one hundred paces from the city, when, at
its gate, the Castilian nobles appeared, bearing the Standard
of Castile, veiled with black gauze. The nobles made a
sign to Don Alfonso to halt, which he and his followers did:
Rodrigo Diaz then advanced, and, having saluted, addressed
Don Alfonso, not as a king but as a cavalier.</p>

<p>"Don Alfonso!" he said to him, "you are heir to the
kingdom of Castile, and no person has any intention of disputing
your rights. Castile is an honourable land, which
always venerated and defended its sovereigns; but how can
it venerate and defend them if it has not the fullest faith in
their honour? We have always, in Castile, looked upon you
as good and honourable; but now an infamous suspicion
weighs upon you, and it is necessary to destroy it before this
country, always loyal, raises its standards for you. You know
already that the hand of an assassin deprived your brother of
life at the siege of Zamora; although your antecedents justify
you, circumstances cast upon you a terrible suspicion, which
never should rest on him who wears a crown and who is called
upon to rule an honourable and generous people. Well, then,
in order that Castile may love and respect you, in order that
the world may know that he who occupies the throne of Don
Fernando the Great is worthy to occupy it, you must swear in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
Santa Gadea, with your hand on the holy Gospels, that you
had no part in the death of Don Sancho."</p>

<p>Indignation had been colouring the visage of Don Alfonso
whilst the Cid was thus speaking, and all the spectators,
except Rodrigo, were trembling, seeing that he was about to
burst out into anger.</p>

<p>"God's justice!" he then exclaimed, "who is it that dares
to speak thus to me? Who is it that dares to demand of me
this shameful oath?"</p>

<p>"Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar!" answered the Cid, not with
haughty insolence, but respectfully and firmly.</p>

<p>"I would renounce, not only the kingdom of Castile, but
even the empire of the entire world, rather than submit to
the humiliation which you propose to me, Cid! Does any good
cavalier suspect my loyalty to such a degree that he can
suppose me to be an accomplice in the death of my brother?
I cast in your face, and in the faces of all who think as you
do, the infamy with which you desire to sully me!"</p>

<p>"Sire," replied the Cid, "by refusing to take the oath you
afford fresh motives to those who suspect you"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, then," exclaimed Don Alfonso, interrupting Rodrigo,
"let us get on to the church. But woe to those who insult
me! Woe to those who dare to humiliate me, in a way that
a king was never before humiliated!"</p>

<p>"After the oath," humbly replied Rodrigo, "you will be
my king, and it will be in your power to dispose of my life
and of my property as it may seem well to you; now, however,
I willingly risk both in order to comply with the dictates of
my conscience and of my honour."</p>

<p>Castilians and Leonese then proceeded to the Church of
Santa Gadea, around the gates of which thronged the multitude,
scarce able to repress the admiration with which they
were filled by the abnegation and heroic firmness of the Cid.</p>

<p>He and Don Alfonso approached the altar, at the foot of
which the prince knelt down, placing his hand on the Book of
the Evangelists, which Rodrigo supported on his, whilst Don
Diego Ordoñez de Lara held the Standard of Castile at some
distance, and all the nobles, wondering and timorous at the
same time, contemplated the imposing scene. The populace,
who crowded up to the entrance of the church, endeavouring
to see what was taking place within it, kept silence, anxious to
hear the oath of the prince, for whom, a moment after, they
were about to raise their standards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don Alfonso," said the Cid in a loud voice, "do you
swear, on the holy Evangelists, that you had no part in the
death of Don Sancho, your brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I swear it!" answered Don Alfonso.</p>

<p>"If you swear truly, may you be always happy and
prosperous on this earth, and may you be safe from the
torments of hell; but if your oath is false, may rustics of the
Asturias of Oviedo kill you, and not those of Castile; may
you die by shepherds' crooks and not by lances; may those
who kill you be such as wear coarse sandals, and ride on
asses, instead of mules or horses; may you meet your death
in fields, and not in towns or villages; may your heart be
dragged out through your left side; and may you descend to
hell, to suffer there for ever!"</p>

<p>"Thus let it be," replied Don Alfonso, without, however,
concealing the irritation which the daring of the Cid caused him.</p>

<p>Rodrigo then placed the Book of the Evangelists upon the
altar, and when Don Alfonso arose, he bent his knee before
him and kissed his hand; all the nobles who were present
imitated him.</p>

<p>Don Diego Ordoñez de Lara then pulled off the black
gauze that had veiled the Standard, and went out with it to
the porch of the cathedral, where he cried out three times&mdash;</p>

<p>"Castile for Don Alfonso!"</p>

<p>The populace repeated that cry with joy and enthusiasm,
and in all quarters of the city standards were raised and
proclamations issued, announcing that the throne of Castile
was now occupied.</p>

<p>How different was the spectacle which Burgos offered on that
day, compared with that on the preceding one, when all was
uncertainty as to the future, sadness and mourning; now there
were strong hopes of a prosperous, peaceful, just, and powerful
reign; for Castile would be a large and powerful kingdom, as
it had been in the time of Fernando the Great, and not limited
and surrounded by rival states, as it was under Sancho II.</p>

<p>On account of that propitious event, the Castilian people
were preparing to give themselves up to joyous festivities;
enemy was disposed to hold out his hand to enemy, the rich
to mitigate the hardships of the poor, and the king to grant
liberal gifts to both nobles and civilians.</p>

<p>The rainbow, rich with brilliant hues, showed itself after
the storm, and filled with gladness the souls of all the good
Castilians.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">IN WHICH THIS BOOK ENDS, PROVING THAT GOD GIVES IN
THIS WORLD, BOTH TO THE GOOD AND TO THE BAD, A
SAMPLE OF THE CLOTH WHICH THEY SHALL WEAR IN
THE OTHER WORLD.</p></blockquote>


<p>Some days have passed since the Castilian people raised their
standards for Don Alfonso VI.</p>

<p>It is the morning of St. John's Day. The sky is azure, and
the stars which sprinkled it are gradually disappearing, for the
brightness which precedes the rising sun is beginning to
illumine the east; the breeze is so gentle that the leaves of
the trees, in which the birds sing, scarcely stir, and the golden
corn, amid which is heard the plaintive cooing of the turtle-doves,
is also motionless. That light breeze has, however,
sufficient force to extract the perfumes from the thyme and
hundreds of other herbs and flowers, and to bear them on its
wings, filling the air with sweetness. The white, misty clouds
which veiled the river Carrion, like a web of white and
transparent gauze spread over the plain, had entirely disappeared,
and the morning light was reflected from the
tranquil surface of the stream, like the light of a lamp from a
string of diamonds. What a beautiful sight the banks of the
Carrion present! Here, the ripe corn, the colour of which
shows that the golden dreams of the labourers are realised;
there, trees, the branches of which are bent to the ground by
the luscious fruits, as if they wished to cheer the passer-by
with their sweetness and perfume; farther on, a meadow
covered with flowers, the various colours of which are made
still more varied by the mild breeze, as it gently agitates them
whilst passing along; and finally, a hundred white villages
scattered over the plain, like flocks of pigeons which have
alighted on the cornfields. Singing is heard in all directions,
and a thousand joyful cries fill the air. Who are those that
walk across the plain, singing and shouting? Are they the
young men and women of Carrion, going to gather vervain
on the banks of the river? How is it that, so early, white
columns of smoke arise from the houses scattered over the
plain? How beautiful is St. John's morning shortly after
sunrise!</p>

<p>The sun ascends, shooting torrents of light upon the slopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
and inundating with splendour the plain of Carrion, already
filled with flowers and perfumes, and to the shouts and songs
of the multitude are united the peals of the bells of the town,
in which some festival, much above ordinary ones, is about to
take place. But those bells which cheer up the inhabitants
of the town and of the plain are not those of the Virgin of
Belen, or those of Santa Maria del Camino; they are those
of a new church which rises to the east of the town, of a
church which did not exist on the night during which the
count's castle was devoured by the flames; the blackened
walls of which, half-destroyed, rise on the eminence which
looks down on the town.</p>

<p>Immense crowds pour indeed across the plain from all
quarters. Men and women, people on foot and on horses,
peasants and nobles. Let us listen to the conversations of
some of those who flock to that festival, the object of which
is still unknown to us.</p>

<p>"By the soul of Beelzebub, even at the battle of the Oca
Mountains there was not such a multitude as there is to-day
on the plain of Carrion!" exclaims a dark-complexioned
man, who is amid a group of men and women, standing on
an eminence beside the Burgos road, looking down on the
plain.</p>

<p>By my life that man is Fernan, mounted on Overo, although
just now he does not carry the accoutrements of a squire!
The woman who is at his side, mounted on a donkey, is
Mayor, and in the same group are other persons, not unknown
to us: for instance, Martin Vengador, Rui-Venablos, and
Beatrice, who are riding, the latter on an ass, like Mayor, and
the men on horses.</p>

<p>Let us listen to Fernan, who, to judge by the attention
which the bystanders are bestowing on him, must be intimately
acquainted with everything concerning those festivities.</p>

<p>"The tournament which is to take place on the plain of
Carrion," he says, "will be the most famous that has ever
been seen or heard of in Spain. They are going to celebrate,
in magnificent style, the coronation of Don Alfonso, as King
of Castile and Leon."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, friend," asked a bystander, "why Don
Alfonso has taken it into his head to have those famous
festivities on the plain of Carrion instead of in Leon or
Burgos?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, brother," replied Fernan; "as Carrion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
stands in the centre of the two kingdoms, now united again,
as in the time of Don Fernando, and as the country is so
beautiful and level, Don Alfonso has desired to celebrate the
festivities in a place to which it is an easy journey for both
Castilians and Leonese."</p>

<p>"And do you know who are to take part in the jousts?"</p>

<p>"The most noble cavaliers of Leon and Castile, and it is
even said that the king, Don Alfonso, will break a lance with
De Lara, the Campeador, and other distinguished cavaliers."</p>

<p>"Those festivities, then, will be worth seeing."</p>

<p>"Of course they will; there will be ring, wand, and other
games, and finally a passage-at-arms, which Guillen of the
Standard will defend, not alone to celebrate the coronation of
Don Alfonso, but also to celebrate his own marriage."</p>

<p>"And to whom is that youth going to be married?"</p>

<p>"This very day he marries the Infanta of Carrion, in the
convent which Doña Teresa built at her own expense for the
nuns of San Zoil, who are going to it to-day. She did that to
repay the hospitality which she received from them on the
night that Guillen rescued her from the burning castle. The
Campeador and his wife, Doña Teresa, my lord and lady, will
give them away, and for that purpose they are in Carrion since
yesterday. Just listen how the bells of San Zoil are pealing!
I would lay a wager that at this very moment they are uniting
for ever the hero of the Standard with the Infanta."</p>

<p>"The marriage of Doña Teresa and Guillen must be great
happiness for them; people say that they love each other very
much."</p>

<p>"Brother, there is one here&mdash;ay, more than one&mdash;who can
speak with certainty regarding such happiness. This honoured
lady, who is beside me on the donkey, and I have got married,
for love only, a few days ago, and also that brave youth and
the young woman, over there, who are talking so lovingly to
each other."</p>

<p>"I wish joy to you all, for you must be happy when you
love so sincerely."</p>

<p>"We love each other, and are now well off, for the lords
of Vivar, our masters&mdash;may God bless and prosper them!&mdash;have
given us very rich gifts."</p>

<p>"It does not astonish me that the Campeador has been
liberal to his servitors, for Don Alfonso has given a good
example to all. It is said that the favours which the king
has bestowed are enormous; and, being so, I am surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
that he has not shown himself indulgent also towards those
lords whom Don Sancho exiled, by pardoning them and
allowing them to return."</p>

<p>"Far from doing that, he has taken their estates from them,
in order to bestow them on their next-of-kin; and he has
imposed the penalty of death on them if they should set foot
in Castile or Leon. And, by my soul, Don Alfonso has done
well, for those counts deserve it richly. The king has strong
suspicions&mdash;and those also who are not kings&mdash;that those
accursed counts, and especially De Carrion, were the persons
who paid Bellido to assassinate the brave Don Sancho."</p>

<p>Those who were thus talking had now descended to the
plain; they ceased their conversation, for the crowds that were
about them absorbed their attention, presenting to them a
thousand different scenes. A minute afterwards they were
amid the animated multitude, and joined in the general
rejoicings.</p>

<p>An hour after, King Alfonso, accompanied by Castilian and
Leonese nobles, arrived on the centre of the plain; the platforms
which had been erected, as if by magic, were occupied
by a thousand noble and beautiful women, and the games were
commencing to the sounds of numerous musical instruments,
the sounds of which filled the air and increased the enjoyment
of all the spectators.</p>

<p>Whilst the plain, rich with light, harmony, flowers, and
happiness, offered such enchanting scenes to the sight, another
scene, entirely different, was being enacted in a wood filled
with briars and ancient chestnut trees, situated on the slope
of one of the hills which bound the plain, and at a short
distance from the road.</p>

<p>About fifty men were in it, some tranquilly sleeping, stretched
on the grass, others viewing with delight the magnificent
spectacle which was offered by the plain, which from that
point could be seen to its fullest extent; and others still,
under the spreading branches of the trees, watching the
approaches to the wood.</p>

<p>These men were bandits; they were Juan Centellos and his
band, whom the Salvadores were pursuing in vain; for they
laughed at their efforts and baffled them, sometimes by their
cleverness and sometimes by means of the money which they
possessed, especially since they had sacked and burned the
Castle of Carrion.</p>

<p>Juan Centellos and another bandit, who seemed to be his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
second in command, began to speak in a low voice, as soon as
the former had sent away a peasant, who, shortly before, had
entered the wood and conversed with Juan for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Have we good news?" the lieutenant asked.</p>

<p>"The spy has indeed brought good news from Carrion,"
answered Centellos. "The bird will soon fly into the net."</p>

<p>"How so, comrade? Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"Don Suero has taken refuge in an ancient castle which he
possesses in Senra, a solitary valley in the Asturias, despairing
of being able to conquer his opponents there, and fearful of
dying on the gallows if he sets foot in Castile or Leon. It
appears that, desirous of having someone to amuse him in
his solitude, he sent to seek out, by means of Bellido,
that wench whom we found in the castle, but did not kill,
as we did not wish to stain our hands with the blood of a
woman; and this very day Bellido is to pass along here with
her."</p>

<p>"Anger of hell! what a fortunate day we shall have if that
traitor, who sold the band of the Vengador, falls into our
hands! We also will celebrate the coronation of Don Alfonso,
and will not leave it altogether to those down below on the
plain."</p>

<p>"Bellido shall not escape us on this occasion, as he did
on that night some time ago. I once swore to hang him on
the ramparts of the Castle of Carrion, in which, through his
vile treachery, so many of our comrades perished; and if, as
I hope, we capture him to-day, he shall appear to-morrow as
a scarecrow on the blackened walls of the burned edifice.
We must keep our eyes open, comrades, for I have been told
that the Salvadores are in this neighbourhood; doubtless to
see to the safety of all those who have come to take part in
the festivities."</p>

<p>The officers of the band had got thus far in their conversation
when they were interrupted by a whistle, which was a
perfect imitation of that of a blackbird.</p>

<p>"People are approaching, and the lookouts are giving the
signal," said Juan Centellos; and he added, looking towards
the road, "It is a man who is carrying a woman behind him
on his horse. May the demon carry me off if it is not he of
whom we are in search! To the road, to the road, comrades!"</p>

<p>And Juan Centellos and some of his men took up their
arms and hurried in the direction of the road.</p>

<p>The man indeed whom they had seen was Bellido Dolfos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
and the woman he was carrying behind him on the horse was
Sancha, the daughter of the blind lute-player, the mistress of
Don Suero.</p>

<p>Bellido put spurs to his horse, but the bandits barred his
way. He then drew his sword, resolved to defend himself
obstinately. Vain, however, were all his endeavours, for in a
few moments he was disarmed by the bandits and dragged,
together with Sancha, into the wood of chestnut trees.</p>

<p>Bellido indeed deserved to suffer on earth all the tortures
of hell, and the wretched woman, who accompanied him, was
not worthy of compassion, for she had become degraded to
that extent that she avoided her blind father, who was seeking
her all over the country; and it was she also who had aided
Don Suero and the Count of Cabra to allure the Cid and his
escort, when going to the Cortes of Leon, into the ambush,
where, almost by a miracle, their lives were preserved; notwithstanding
all this, it is repugnant to us to mention the
cruelties of which they, especially Bellido Dolfos, were the
victims when they fell into the hands of the bandits.</p>

<p>"Comrades," said Juan Centellos to the members of his
band, "let this woman go and bring the news to her noble
lover; we shall take good care of Bellido."</p>

<p>The bandits then seized on the traitor and dragged him to
a very large chestnut tree, the trunk of which was hollow, and
into which a man could enter through an aperture which was
almost on a level with the ground. They shoved him into
the hollow trunk notwithstanding the furious resistance which
he made to avoid it; they then closed up the hole with a large
flat stone which they carried to it, and against this they placed
others, so that no man's strength, exerted from within, could
push them away.</p>

<p>It was but a short time since they had restored freedom to
Sancha, when the whistle of the blackbird was again heard,
and those who were watching the approaches to the wood,
hastened to descend from the trees, crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Salvadores! the Salvadores are approaching!"</p>

<p>All the bandits made preparations to take to flight, for,
indeed, a large body of Salvadores was coming from the
direction towards which Sancha had gone.</p>

<p>"Let us kill Bellido before we go!" cried several, and they
were about to remove the stones which closed the entrance
into the trunk of the chestnut tree.</p>

<p>"Let no one touch those stones!" said Juan Centellos; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
he added, with a sinister smile, "I should like Bellido to get
accustomed to fire before he goes to hell."</p>

<p>He then applied a burning torch to the bushes and
brambles which grew round the chestnut tree, and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, comrades, let us get away!"</p>

<p>The bandits dispersed themselves through the wood, endeavouring
to get to the rear of the Salvadores, for in that
direction the ground was more broken and the trees closer
together. The Salvadores were following the principal body,
composed of Juan Centellos and about twenty of his men.</p>

<p>"Comrades," said their chief to those bandits, halting on an
eminence, now almost safe from his pursuers, "through a
foolish act we were near falling into the hands of our enemies,
for it was a great piece of stupidity to let the companion of
Bellido go free; it was she, doubtless, who gave information
to the Salvadores. But&mdash;justice of God! Is it not she who
is walking along the road down there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, it is she!" cried all the bandits.</p>

<p>"My good crossbow," said Juan, descending towards the
road, "aid my revenge as thou hast always aided it!"</p>

<p>The leader of the bandits shot an arrow, and Sancha uttered
a cry of agony and fell, mortally wounded.</p>

<p>At the same time immense columns of smoke and flame
arose from the wood, and horrible cries, becoming weaker by
degrees, were heard proceeding from the place where the fire
had commenced.</p>

<p>Those cries ceased altogether in a few minutes, and an hour
after there were neither chestnut trees, bushes, nor anything else
left but heaps of glowing ashes and a few calcined stones,
where the bandits had enclosed Bellido Dolfos in the hollow
tree.</p>

<p>The following morning was as beautiful as that which had
preceded it: the sky was azure, the air was fall of perfumes,
the birds were singing in the trees, and everywhere were
exhibited the animation and pleasure of those who were
returning from the festivities that had taken place at
Carrion.</p>

<p>The Cid, Ximena, the Infanta, Doña Teresa, Martin, Beatrice,
Rui-Venablos, Gonzalo, Alvar, and, last, Fernan and Mayor,
were travelling together along the road to Burgos; all joyful,
all content, all happy, except the two last-mentioned, who had
had a serious disagreement on that morning. Fernan, remembering
the pretty girls whom he had seen on the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
day at the festival, was bitterly lamenting the tyranny of
matrimony, which, among Christians, does not permit more
than one wife, when, according to his infallible calculations,
two, at least, should be allowed to each man. Those complaints
and those calculations naturally irritated Mayorica;
Fernan cursed the wrong-headedness and stupidity of women,
of his wife especially, and the quarrel ended in scratches and
blows, Alvar receiving some of them as he had endeavoured
to pacify the combatants.</p>

<p>Some hours after they had left Carrion, on arriving at a
cross-roads, they heard the sounds of a lute, which an old man,
seated by the wayside, was playing, and, at the same time, was
asking charity from the passers-by.</p>

<p>The Cid and Ximena sent one of their servants to give alms
to the mendicant, and Guillen and Teresa did the same. The
old man began, just then, to sing a ballad which commenced
thus&mdash;</p>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"Cavaliers of Leon,<br />
Castilian cavaliers!<br />
Haughty with the strong,<br />
But gentle with the weak."<br />
</p>

</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>"By St. James of Compostela!" exclaimed the Cid, pulling
up Babieca when he heard those lines. "It is the old man
who, in the name of God, told me on the road to Zamora that
I should conquer in all my battles, and that my honour and
my prosperity would ever increase."</p>

<p>The blind man continued his ballad, calling for vengeance
on him who had stolen his daughter.</p>

<p>"You have already been avenged!" said solemnly some of
the listeners, amongst whom was Rui-Venablos, for all of them
knew of the tragic end of Sancha, and of the unhappy life to
which Don Suero Gonzalez was condemned.</p>

<p>The Cid approached the mendicant and said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Old man, if the sword of a cavalier has not struck the
head of the Count of Carrion, the justice of God has sentenced
him to misery, to infamy, to loneliness, and to despair, which
are worse than death. Your daughter disowned you, and
ceased thinking of you almost as soon as she was separated
from you; but she also has suffered the chastisement which
her crimes deserved. Do not weep for her: she merits
oblivion and not your curse. Have you not a family which
will console your grief and support your old age? Yes, you
will find such in my castle. Get into one of the litters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
come to share the happiness which smiles on the lords of
Vivar."</p>

<p>The old man then got into a litter, weeping with gratitude
and joy, and the travellers continued their way, all joyous,
contented, and happy, for even Fernan and Mayor were
beginning to make peace.</p>
